Clam AntiVirus Plugin
---------------------

This plugin will scan incoming messages for viruses using 
Clam AntiVirus.

To build the plugin run configure with --enable-clamav-plugin

Messages that have infected attachments can be deleted or moved
to a folder that can be specified in the configuration, if the
folder is not specified or not found the default trash folder will
be used.

Please note that the clamav_plugin.so plugin only provides the
actual scanning. By default it is not enabled. You probably also 
want to load the clamav_plugin_gtk.so to get a configuration page
under "Configuration/Other Preferences..." for the Clam AntiVirus
plugin.

The Clam AntiVirus plugin uses its own block in the sylpheedrc file
in your ~/.sylpheed directory. If you really want to configure it
without the GTK plugin you can specify the following options:

[ClamAV]
clamav_enable=1				enable scanning with Clam AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_enable_archive=1			enable archive scanning with Clam 
					AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_max_size=1			maximum size an attachment can have
					(in MB), larger attachments will not
					be scanned
					[default: 1]

clamav_receive_infected=1		enable to save infected messages to a 
					mailfolder. If not enabled the mails will 
					be deleted
					[default: 1]
clamav_save_folder=#mh/Mailbox/virus	the folder that should be used to save
					infected mails, if empty the default 
					trash folder is used
					[default: none, use default trash]
