Clam AntiVirus Plugin
---------------------

This plugin will scan incoming messages for viruses using 
Clam AntiVirus (libclamav). It can be used with Local, IMAP
and POP accounts.

Messages that have infected attachments can be automatically
deleted or moved to a folder that can be specified in the 
configuration, if the folder is not specified or not found 
the default trash folder will be used.

The plugin is built automatically if you have the required
libraries available. It will be installed in
$PREFIX/lib/claws-mail/plugins/ as clamav_plugin.so.

Configuration preferences are found on the 
"/Configuration/Preferences.../Plugins/Clam AntiVirus" page.

The Clam AntiVirus plugin uses its own block in the 'clawsrc' 
file in your config directory (default: '~/.claws-mail'). It
has the following options:

[ClamAV]
clamav_enable=1				enable scanning with Clam AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_enable_arc=1			enable archive scanning with Clam 
					AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_max_size=1			maximum size an attachment can have
					(in MB), larger attachments will not
					be scanned
					[default: 1]

clamav_recv_infected=1			enable to save infected messages to a 
					mailfolder. If not enabled the mails 
					will be deleted
					[default: 1]
					
clamav_save_folder=#mh/Mailbox/virus	the folder that should be used to save
					infected mails, if empty the default 
					trash folder is used
					[default: none, use default trash]
