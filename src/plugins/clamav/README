Clam AntiVirus Plugin
---------------------

This plugin will scan incoming messages for viruses using 
Clam AntiVirus (libclamav). It can be used with Local, IMAP
and POP accounts.

Messages that have infected attachments can be automatically
deleted or moved to a folder that can be specified in the 
configuration, if the folder is not specified or not found 
the default trash folder will be used.

The plugin is built automatically if you have the required
libraries available. It has two parts and will be installed
in $PREFIX/lib/sylpheed/plugins/ as clamav_plugin.so and
clamav_plugin_gtk.so.

The 'clamav_plugin.so' plugin provides only the actual 
scanning. By default it is not enabled. 

You will probably also want to load the configuration plugin
'clamav_plugin_gtk.so' to get a configuration page under 
"Configuration/Other Preferences.../Filtering/Clam AntiVirus" 
for the Clam AntiVirus plugin.

The Clam AntiVirus plugin uses its own block in the 'sylpheedrc' 
file in your config directory (default: '~/.sylpheed'). If you 
really want to configure it without the GTK plugin you can 
specify the following options:

[ClamAV]
clamav_enable=1				enable scanning with Clam AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_enable_arc=1			enable archive scanning with Clam 
					AntiVirus
					[default: 0]

clamav_max_size=1			maximum size an attachment can have
					(in MB), larger attachments will not
					be scanned
					[default: 1]

clamav_recv_infected=1			enable to save infected messages to a 
					mailfolder. If not enabled the mails 
					will be deleted
					[default: 1]
					
clamav_save_folder=#mh/Mailbox/virus	the folder that should be used to save
					infected mails, if empty the default 
					trash folder is used
					[default: none, use default trash]
