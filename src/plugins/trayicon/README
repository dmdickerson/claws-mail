Trayicon Plugin
---------------

This plugin puts a little icon into the system tray. The system tray
has to be compatible to the system tray protocol specification from
http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/.  System trays know to work are
available for Gnome 2 (Notification Area Applet) and KDE 3.1.1.

The plugin uses a backport of the GTK eggtray widget from Gnome 2. Not
all features of GTK+ 2 are available in GTK+ 1.2 and so I'm not sure
if the plugin will properly work. It is a known problem that the icon
sometimes does not dock into the system tray and opens in a seperate
window. The reason for this is unknown. If you are sure that your system
tray is working correctly or if it worked before restarting claws-mail
fixes this in most cases.

The icon in the system tray will show you if you have new or unread
mail. If the mailbox is empty you have no unread mails, if a letter is
properly put into it you have unread mails, a letter that was just put
into it indicates new mail.

The icon also has a tooltip. If you keep the mouse 1 second over the
icon a tooltip showing the text "New: xxx, Unread: xxx, Total: xxx"
will appear, where xxx is the number of new, unread and total messages.

It is planned to add a popup menu that can be opened with the right mouse
button to execute some quick actions.  Ideas for the menu are currently
to start a check for new mails and to open a compose window.

Another idea is to allow to hide the claws-mail main window completely by
clicking on the icon with the left mouse button. This currently breaks
the automatic mail check. If these problems have been solved the feature
will be available.
