SpamAssassin Plugin
-------------------

This plugin will filter incoming messages using SpamAssassin. Like the
spamc command from the SpamAssassin package the message is send to a
spamd server that decides if the message is spam or not.

To build the plugin run configure with --enable-spamassassin-plugin

Message that are classified as spam can be deleted or moved to a folder
that can be specified in the configuration, if the folder is not
specified or not found the default trash folder will be used.

Please note that the spamassassin.so plugin only provides the actual
filtering. By default it is not enabled. You probably want to load the
spamassassin_gtk.so plugin too to get a configuration page under
"Configuration/Other Preferences..." for the SpamAssassin plugin.

The SpamAssassin plugin uses it's own block in the sylpheedrc file in your
~/.sylpheed directory. If you really want to configure it without the GTK
plugin you can specify the following options:

[SpamAssassin]
enable=1				enable filtering with SpamAssassin
					[default: 0]

hostname=localhost			hostname of the spamd server
					[default: localhost]

port=783				port the spamd server uses
					[default: 783]

max_size=250				maximum size a mail can have (in kB)
					larger mails will not be filtered
					[default: 250]

receive_spam=1				enable to save spam to a mailfolder
					if not enabled the mails will be deleted,
					please note that this is dangerout and you
					might lose an important mail that is
					classified as spam by mistake
					[default: 1]

save_folder=#mh/Mail/trash/Spam		the folder that should be used to save
					spam mails, if empty the default trash
					folder is used
					[default: none, use default trash]
