SpamAssassin Plugin
-------------------

This plugin will filter incoming messages using SpamAssassin. Like the
spamc command from the SpamAssassin package the message is send to a
spamd server that decides if the message is spam or not.

To build the plugin run configure with --enable-spamassassin-plugin

The spamd server localtion is currently fixed to localhost:783. If you
want to change that spamd's location you have to edit the lines in the
spamassassin_read_config function in spamassassin.c until a configuration
for the plugin is available. The plugin is also configured to filter
only messages that are smaller then 250kB.

Message that are classified as spam will be moved to the default trash
folder.

libspamc.[ch] and utils.[ch] are copied from the SpamAssassin package. I
hope SpamAssassin will provide their functions as a library with the
required includes files in the future for easier building. Building the
library as a shared object is already possible, but it is not installable
with the package and the includes are also not available.
