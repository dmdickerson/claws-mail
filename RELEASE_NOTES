		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* IMAP with STARTTLS
  The certificate port on TLS was fixed, however this will trigger
  one wrong 'New certificate' warning on the first connection.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added an option, "Use secure file deletion if possible", which
  enables shredding of temporary files and messages instead of
  just removing them. This is available on the Other preferences
  page.

* Added an option, "Select the HTML part of multipart/alternative
  messages". This is available on the Message View/Text Options
  preferences page. 

* Added an option to the 'Create new folder' dialogue which enables
  new folders to inherit the properties of their parent folders
  during folder creation.

* Added a hidden option, "two_line_vertical", which toggles the
  2-line view in the message list when using the 3-column layout.
  Defaults to '1', show 2 lines.

* Added a hidden option, "outgoing_fallback_to_ascii", which allows
  the user to specify an outgoing charset/encoding, but still fall
  back to 7bit US-ASCII when possible.
  Defaults to '1', fallback when possible.

* Added support for the Avant Window Navgator (Awn) information
  bubble. This is automatically enabled if dbus is available.

* Face and X-Face headers can now be added globally and per-account
  from configuration files under ~/.claws-mail/autofaces/. Further
  information is provided in the manual.

* The SHA1 fingerprint is now shown on the SSL certificate dialogue
  and the labels are now selectable.

* Several GUI improvements have been made, (Address book, filtering
  dialogue, Actions dialogue, and Account preferences).

* New icons have been added for 'Reply to list' and 'Cancel'. The
  'Insert file' and 'Close' icons have been improved, as have the
  tray icons.	

* Added the Trash and Delete icons to the Custom Toolbars options.

* SMTP-only accounts are now not shown in the Receive menus and
  Account lists in filtering/processing, as they are irrelevant here.

* tools/csv2addressbook.pl
  Support for a gmail exported csv address book was added.

* Updated English, French, and Spanish manuals.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish, French,
  German, and Spanish.
