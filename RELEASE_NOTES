		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Claws Mail was previously known as Sylpheed-Claws.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Sylpheed-Claws is now known as Claws Mail.
  The default configuration directory is now ~/.claws-mail. The main
  configuration file is now called 'clawsrc'. When running this
  version of Claws Mail for the first time all of the configuration
  will be automatically migrated to the new location and it will be
  seamless for the user. A 'sylpheed-claws' symlink pointing to
  'claws-mail' will be installed, therefore all scripts and other apps
  configured to use 'sylpheed-claws' will still function correctly.
