Sylpheed-Claws is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This is a bugfix release.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Always obey the "confirm before marking all mails read" option

* Fixed MBOX import/export's behaviour on failure

* Fixed automatic rule creation with List-Post

* Fixed some GTK+ warnings and errors at runtime

* Fixed some compiler warnings

* Fixed double init of the g_thread subsystem

* Fixed saving of parts with names that can't be converted to UTF-8

* Fixed a possible infinite loop when filtering moved and copied some
  mails

* Fixed a buffer overflow in Russian locale 

* Fixed a memory leak in expired SSL certificate check

* Fixed bolding of folder names in the folder selector window with
  GLib 2.10

* Added an hidden preference, 'ssl_skip_cert_check', to avoid
  duplicates of bug #959 - if libetpan is linked against gnutls, there
  can be bugs on 64 bits systems. Gnutls fixed them in their 1.2.4 
  release.

  session

* Fixed races when reusing the SMTP sessions

* Added the missing timeout on SMTP sessions

* Fixed a few leaks

* Fixed a crash in PGP plugins, which could happen when signing fails
  for unknown reasons

* Fixed SpamAssassin plugin, which stayed disabled as long as the
  transport wasn't reselected

* Fixed bug #830 (Some unread messages get marked read in IMAP inbox)

* Fixed bug #955 (copying messages between imap folders is extremely
  slow)

* Fixed bug #961 (return receipt dialog complains incorrectly about
  return-path email adress being different)

* Fixed bug #962 (Manual and/or UI should warn about incompatible
  locking causing dataloss)
