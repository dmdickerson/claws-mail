		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Non-blocking NNTP has been implemented. NNTP support is now provided
	by and depends upon libetpan

GnuTLS support has been implemented as an alternative to OpenSSL.
	[./configure --enable-gnutls]

A run-time alternative configuration directory switch has been added,
	[claws-mail --alternate-config-dir DIR]

Tags: Added tag alphabetical sorting and unified the dialogues.

Edit accounts dialogue: The 'default account' (D) column has been
	removed, instead the default account is indicated by use of
	bold text.

Templates: Added ability to attach files using |attach{filename}.
    Templates options are now presented in a tabbed layout.

Address Book: Added duplicate finder, '/Tools/Find duplicates'.
    It is now possible to set an image for each contact. Pictures 
	from a contact's Face or X-Face will be automatically set
	when available. The contact's image will be automatically
	displayed in the message view or header pane if the message
	has no Face or X-Face header.

'/View/Character encoding' submenus are now grouped together

GTK+ built-in print support is now used if GTK+ >= 2.10 is available.
	libgnomeprint will never be used if GTK+ >= 2.10 is available.

Reinstated 'Generate Message-ID' option as an Account preference. It
	is hidden on IMAP accounts, because Message-IDs are needed on
	servers that don't implement the UIDPLUS extension.

Toolbar preferences: Improved dialogue.

Compose window: the number of attachments is now shown in the tab's
	title.

Attachments: When opening attachments with 'Open' or 'Open with...'
	the temporary files are now saved as read-only. A hidden
	preference has been added, 'save_parts_readwrite', which
	permits the previous behaviour.

IMAP: Added a button on the Folder Properties General page to allow
	users to discard local caches.
    Added much better error handling.
    Fetching of cached mails has been heavily optimised.

LDAP: Added read-only support for jpegPhoto LDAP field

Bcc in commandline URIs has been added.

Dillo browser plugin: Address book based whitelisting for loading
	remote images has been added.

SpamAssassin plugin: Address book based whitelisting has been added.

MAEMO: Maemo 4.0 (Chinook) build enabled.

MAEMO: Removed some useless tooltips.

tools/csv2addressbook.pl
	a new script that imports a CSV formatted address book. Becky
	and Thunderbird address book are currently supported.

Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Finnish, French, German,
	Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Simplified Chinese, and Slovak
