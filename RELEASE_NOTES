		    SYLPHEED-CLAWS  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.sylpheed-claws.net
		      
Sylpheed-Claws is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* libetpan 0.48 or greater is now required for IMAP support.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Compose window now has an /Options/Reply mode/ menu. This
  enables changing the recipients of a reply on the fly.

* QuickSearch now has a type-ahead option for fast searches.

* Extra symbols are now available for the Quote parser, your name,
  your email address, the account name, and the organization.

* In the Folder Properties, it is now possible to test the regular
  expression used in the Simplify Subject RegExp option.

* GSSAPI support has been added for IMAP.

* UIDPLUS support has been added for IMAP.

* A Stop button has been added for Message Body searches, enabling
  cancelling of a running search. This is available in '/Edit/Search
  Folder...' and '/Edit/Find in current message...'.

* libSM support has been added. This enables communication with the
  session manager, so that it is known when the session ends, in
  order to save the caches, and draft any messages currently being
  composed.

* Support for Address Book Groups has been added to the Compose
  window's automatic address completion.

* a new hidden option has been added, 'respect_flowed_format'. This
  follows RFC3676 with regard to a message part with a Content-Type
  that includes 'format=flowed' and 'delsp=yes'. This will cause some
  mails to have long lines, but will fix some URLs that would
  otherwise be wrapped. By default it is turned off.

* Basic key import/export has been added to the PGP plugins. When
  generating a new key pair you can export the public key to a key
  server. When selecting the signature part of a message, if the key
  is not on your keyring, you will be asked if you want to attempt
  to import it from a keyserver.

* The TrayIcon now displays 'offline' status.

* More window sizes and placements are remembered across sessions.

* tools/fix_date.sh: Switches to replace non RFC-compliant Date:
  value, and to use strict RFC matching patterns for dates have been
  added.

* Several optimisations have been made.

* The manual has been updated.

* Updated translations in Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French,
  German, Italian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish 

* Bug fixes:
	o bug 1035, 'Incorrect handling of flowed lines'
	o bug 1036, 'Forwarding a mutlipart mail with a "text/html"
		    block to ms outlook users leeds to freeze of
