26th February 2007                                   Claws Mail 2.8.0

		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed 'Separate Folder tree' and 'Separate Message View' and put
  new layouts in place of it, 'Standard', 'Three columns', 'Wide
  message' and 'Wide message list'. Accessible from /View/Layout.

* Added IMAP subscriptions
  Creating a new folder subscribes it. Deleting a folder unsubscribes
  it. "Creating" an existing but unsubscribed folder will subscribe
  it. By default, for new accounts, only subscribed folders are shown.
  A contextual menu item has been added, /Subscriptions,  which allows
  switching the display between All folders and Subscribed folders
  only. It also enables the subscribing and unsubscribing of folders. 

* Added the option 'Enable customisable menu shortcuts' to the
  'Other' preferences page. Turning this off locks the current hot
  keys, preventing accidental changes.

* Added icons for application/pdf, application/pgp-signature,
  application/postscript and text/calendar.

* Added /Tools/List URIs
  Enables opening any or all of the URIs contained in the currently
  selected mail.

* Added 'spam flag' to the Filtering and Processing Match Types.

* Removed the 'Composing messages exist' dialogue on exit. Instead
  opened messages are automatically saved to drafts, and re-opened at
  the next startup.

* Added handling of local URIs, (file:///...), from the --attach
  command line.

* Added Account options for spellcheck default dictionaries.

* Added 'Edit/Delete thread'.

* Added an option 'Ask about account specific filtering rules...' to
  the 'Other' page, which was previously a hidden option.

* Some preferences have been re-arranged:
  Moved the 'Ask before emptying trash' option on the 'Other' page
  outside of the 'On exit' frame as it's not only an 'On exit' option.
  Moved 'Never send Return Receipts' from 'Other'  to 'Sending' page.
  Moved keybinding preferences to the 'Other' page.
  Added 'mousepad' to the list of text editors on the 'External
  Programs' page.

* Bogofilter and SpamAssassin plugins:	Enabled moving spam mail to the
  Account's Trash folder instead of default Trash folder.

* ClamAV plugin: updated for the upstream changes in libclamav, whilst
  maintaining compatibility with older version of libclamav.

* GPG Plugins: Added an option 'Use gpg-agent to manage passwords' to
  GPG page of the common preferences. Fixes annoyances with distro-
  installed gpg-agent, when no pinentry program is installed, and the
  user is at a loss on why "decryption failed". It can be turned off
  to bypass gpg-agent. The option is disabled if gpg-agent is not
  running.

* TrayIcon plugin: Added 'Hide at startup' and 'Close to tray'
  options.
  When the 'Close to tray' option is used the Window Manager's hotkey
  and [X] button will hide the window instead of closing it - closing
  CM can be done using the tray icon menu or the /File menu.
  Clicking the trayicon now raises the window to current desktop when
  it was either minimized or shaded, or when it was on another desktop.

* Added support for non ISO-8859-1 compatible locales to the Actions
  scripts freshmeat_search.pl, google_search.pl and multiwebsearch.pl.
		
* Renamed the maildir2claws-mail.pl script to kmail-mailbox2claws-mail.pl
  and updated it to work with newer versions of Kmail. 

* Added thunderbird-filters-convertor.pl script, which converts
  thunderbird filter rules to Claws filter rules.

* Updated Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Czech, Finnish,
  French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Serbian, Simplified Chinese,
  Slovak and Spanish translations.

* Bug fixes:
	o bug 1033, 'Automatically refresh message list when new
		     messages arrives'
	o bug 1106, 'Claws crash on exit if LDAPS autocompletion
		     was used'
	o bug 1110, 'pgpmime fails to process encapsulated openpgp
		     mime (rfc 3156, 6.1 -> rfc1847)'
	o bug 1116, 'summary view allow a subject line break'
	o bug 1117, 'fcntl locking code does not work in mbox.c'
	o bug 1123, 'Segmentation fault while opening address book'
	o Gentoo bug 165819, 'can't create a "local mbox file" account'
	* Fixed bug that prevented colorization from working in the
          Compose window without the wrap quotation option.
	* Fixed address completion issues.
	* Fixed focus issues after hiding the Quick Search
	* Don't encode ',' in URIs before passing it to the browser
	  command-line.
	* Fixed markup being shown in the alert panel
	* Recognize .utf8 locales as .UTF-8 ones
	* Fixed code conversion when dragging a file
	* Fixed 'warn if there are queued messages' option, which
	  only checked the first mailbox's queue
	* Fixed default hotkeys in Compose's Send menu.
	* Plug some memory leaks.
