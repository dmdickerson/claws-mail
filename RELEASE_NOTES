		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Claws Mail was previously known as Sylpheed-Claws.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The --select option can now also select emails by Message-ID

* Attaching files from 'mailto:' URIs (&attach=...) is now possible.
  A dialog is displayed to make sure that the user is aware that the
  mail will contain attachments

* 'New Message format' has been added to the Compose/Writing options,
  this works like the Quote format and the same symbols are supported

* Reworked the About dialog, including the addition of a new page, 
  'Features', which indicates which of the optional features are
  compiled in and which are not. A 'Release Notes' page was also
  added

* Added history combo for all search fields (message and text)

* The 'mark_as_read_delay' option is not hidden anymore and can be
  found in Configuration/Preferences/Summaries

* Added global and per-folder preferences to set the default
  alternate dictionary

* Allow spell-checking to use both current and alternate dictionaries

* Added an hidden option 'addressbook_use_editaddress_dialog' to
  embed the contact editor in the addressbook window in contrast to
  a separate dialog

* Added a hidden option 'unsafe_ssl_certs', to allow storing
  multiple SSL certificates for a given server/port. You will be
  asked to accept unknown certificates. Unchecking this option will
  require you to re-accept previously known certificates

* Allow copying of folders between mailboxes

* Better automatic account selection for mailing lists (searches for
  the email address in the Delivered-To header also)

* Made the "Synchronise" menu item inactive when there's nothing to
  synchronise

* Use Message font in Writing and Quoting preferences, as well as in
  Templates

* Added more HTML symbols to the html to text converter

* Save the addressbook's window size on closing

* Better checks for syntax errors are applied to Templates and Quote
  formats

* Added a check to avoid trying to use a non-existent folder as
  default inbox

* Enable setting SSL via STARTTLS from the set-up wizard

* Added handling of ":port" in server addresses in the set-up wizard
  to specify a port to connect to

* Bogofilter plugin: added an option to print the X-Claws-Bogosity
  header in emails handled by the Bogofilter plugin (in MH folders
  only)

* Bogofilter plugin: added an option to whitelist senders found in
  addressbook

* Bogofilter plugin: Allow storing of Unsure mails in a specific
  folder to make better teaching easier

* Bogofilter plugin: Improved GUI interaction while Bogofilter is
  filtering

* TrayIcon plugin: added an "Email from account/..." submenu

* updated Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Catalan, Finnish,
  French, Italian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, and Spanish
  translations
