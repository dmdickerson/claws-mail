		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default Cc, Bcc and Reply-To options have been added to Folder
  Properties.

* MIME parts that lack an end boundary are now handled, (even though
  they're INVALID!).

* A 'Metadata handling' option has been added to the Miscellaneous
  options page. The options are 'safer' or 'faster'. 'faster' is
  Claws' original behaviour. 'safer' prevents data loss on system
  crashes where the filesystem is of a 'not-so-robust' variety, e.g.
  xfs. If in doubt, use 'safer'. This option defaults to 'safer'.

* Face and X-Face previews have been added to the Custom Header
  Configuration dialogue in Account preferences.

* An option has been added to the Receive page of IMAP account
  preferences, "Move deleted mails to trash and expunge immediately".
  This option is on by default to avoid changing the existing
  behaviour. Turning it off prevents automatic expunging.
  Also, 'Tools/Expunge'  and 'View/Hide deleted messages' menu items
  have been added to main toolbar.

* Support for clickable gopher:// links has been added.

* In the Compose window a warning dialogue is raised if attachments
  that have been added no longer exist on the filesystem at the time
  of sending.

* Buttons to clear header lines in the Compose window have been
  added.

* GnuTLS compatibility mode is now used, this avoids problems with 
  servers that don't comply 100% with the spec, but still exist.

* tools/csv2addressbook.pl
  thunderbird import for version 2.0.0.21 has been added.

* Added Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Slovakian translations.

* Updated Bulgarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Finnish, French,
  German, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, and Spanish translations.
