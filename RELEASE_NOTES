email client.

Notes for this release:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New plugin: Bogofilter, providing Spam filtering and learning

* Account-based filtering rules. Each filtering rule can now be
  assigned to a specific account, by default it's "All".

* Filtering against Address Book. It is now possible add matched 
  conditions to determine if any email address in a message matches
  or doesn't match any or all books or folders in the Address Book.

* Quote folding. Quotes in the message view can now be folded, via
  the "/View/Quotes/..." menu. The folding can also be toggled by
  double clicking on the quotes in the Message View

* Re-enabled user-defined Headers in Displayed Headers configuration

* "/View/Go to/Parent message" and "/View/Go to/Last read message"
  have been added

* Made the list views look more modern by add alternating coloured
  lines, replacing the box-type expanders with arrows, removing the
  dotted lines.
  Hidden prefs have been added to enable users to maintain the old
  style:
  'enable_dotted_lines' for the dotted lines and box-type expanders. 
  'use stripes_in_summary' to enable alternating coloured lines in
   the Message and Folder lists.
  'use stripes_everywhere' to  also enable alternating coloured lines
   in all other lists.
  Note: 'use_stripes_everywhere' replaces the previous hidden option
  'enable_rules_hint'.

* New hidden pref, 'stripes_color_offset', to change the value added/
  subtracted to normal bgcolor to create the stripes in the summaries
 
* The Send button on the main toolbar is now inactive when the Queue
  folders are empty

* IMAP: Added a View Log button on auth error

* PGP/Core plugin: it is now possible to create a new key pair from
  within Sylpheed-Claws

* PGP/Core plugin: When encrypting, if only one key matches, and it 
  matches exactly, it is automatically used

* TrayIcon plugin: the icon now has transparency

* Enabled text selection for replying from MimeViewer plugins

* The attachments list in the MimeView column can now be scrolled
  using the mousewheel

* In the MimeView column a middle-click will now just open the Mime
  part without showing it in the Message View, likewise, a right-
  click will display the context menu without displaying the part

* The "When entering a folder..." selection option is now used for
  '/View/Go to/Next unread folder'

* A special Return-Receipt message is shown if the message is from
  the user

* An icon has been added to the statusbar to notify of errors

* Added missing icons to the Icon Legend dialog

* Enabled closing of SSL certificates and Folder Sort dialogs with Esc
  key

* Displaying of huge mails can now be cancelled, so the GUI doesn't
  block
