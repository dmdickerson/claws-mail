8th February 2008                                    Claws Mail 3.3.0

		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Due to licensing problems, the ClamAV plugin has been removed from
  the Claws Mail core distribution and can now been found packaged
  separately or with the 'extra plugins' package.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added NetworkManager support
  This is built by default if the dependencies are satisfied; it can
  be specifically disabled with '--disable-networkmanager-support'.
  This enables Claws Mail to track changes to the network status.

* Added DIGEST-MD5 support for IMAP authentication

* Added Folder Properties option, 'Run processing rules when opening'
  to the General page.

* Added sub-sorting to the Message List; when the Sort type is either
  Subject, From, To or Tags, sub-sorting by Date will be active.

* Added from=address to the mailto sequence
  The 'from' will try to select the first matching account in the
  Accounts list, otherwise it will use the usual account selection
  mechanism but will override it with the given 'from' address.

* Added insert=FILE  to the mailto sequence (stands for 'insert file')
  This adds the ability to create a new message from the command-line,
  with the body set from the contents of an existing file.
		
* Added mailto with NNTP accounts
  This comes into play if mailto is used when an NNTP account is the
  default account or if an NNTP account address is used with 'from'.

* Added several GUI improvements to the Filtering, Processing, Tags,
  Actions, Templates, Logging and Address Book dialogues

* Added a tooltip to the 'replied' icon in the Message List which
  indicates 'click to see your reply' feature.

* Added 'claws-mail --version-full' to display the version and a list
  of the compiled-in features

* Implemented speed-ups to list operations, deletions and cache
  updates.

* Updated the man page

* The Trayicon plugin icons are now themable.

* text/calendar message parts are now automatically displayed if a
  plugin handling text/calendar is loaded, e.g. vCalendar.

* Maemo: connect HW status change signal for shutdown

* Maemo: identify mmc1 and mmc2 more clearly in the GUI

* Maemo: Make dnd threshold higher

* New translations: Hebrew

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, British English, Czech,
  Finnish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish
