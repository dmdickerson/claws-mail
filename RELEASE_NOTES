		    SYLPHEED-CLAWS  RELEASE NOTES
                      http://claws.sylpheed.org
		      
Sylpheed-Claws is the extended version of Sylpheed, a GTK+ based,
user-friendly, lightweight, and fast email client.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* This is a bug-fix release and all users are advised to upgrade.

* This release is the first release in the newly created Stable
  branch. Primarily, each release will contain bug fixes rather
  than new features. New features will appear in the Development
  branch releases, and will make their way into this Stable branch
  when they have been well-tested. 

  This Stable branch is mainly aimed at distro packagers and the more 
  cautious self-compiler. Users who wish to remain closer to the
  cutting edge should choose the release with the highest version
  number. Normally this will be the Development branch, currently it 
  is this release.

New in this release:

  stored with UTF-8 encoding
