<h2><a name="s2">2. Sylpheed-Claws FAQ - Installation and Configuration</a></h2>
<h2><a name="ss2.1">2.1 Q01 What does it take to compile Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Any POSIX compliant UNIX or similar OS eg. Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris
GTK+ 1.2.6 or later
A recent ANSI C compiler (gcc 2.95 should also
work).
Optionally:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>libcompface (for X-Face)</li>
  <li>libjconv (for I18N)</li>
  <li>GPGME (for GnuPG)</li>
  <li>OpenSSL (for SSL support)<br>
  </li>
  <li>libetpan (for IMAP support)</li>
  <li>libgnomeprintui (for real printing support)</li>
  <li>aspell (for spell checking)</li>
  <li>the equivalent of GTK+-devel and Xfree86-devel.</li>
</ul>
Otherwise ./configure will fail.
<h2><a name="ss2.2">2.2 Q02 How do I set up Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. When you run Sylpheed-Claws for the first time, it will
ask you where you want to store your mailboxes. The
default is &lt;homedir&gt;/Mail. You can change this to
anything you like as long as it is a valid directory
name.
</p>
<p>Please note: When Sylpheed-Claws is executed for the first time, it
automatically creates the configuration files under
$HOME/.sylpheed-gtk2/, and asks you the location of mailbox. The
default is $HOME/Mail. If some files which are non-MH format already
exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.3">2.3 Q03 Why did the creation of the mailbox fail?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Sylpheed-Claws reports such an error if it can't create the
default
mailboxes (inbox, outbox, etc ...). This can be because
&lt;homedir&gt;/Mail
already contains files with the same names. This occurs when switching
from
Kmail to Sylpheed-Claws, in this case backup and remove the existing
Mail
directory or use another name for the Sylpheed-Claws mail directory.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.4">2.4 Q04 How do I set up an account?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. After loading Sylpheed-Claws for the first time, you should
already have an account, as defined by the wizard. However you can
add an e-mail account by clicking the
"Configuration" menu. Select the option "Create new
account" and fill in the appropriate fields.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.5">2.5 Q05 How many accounts can I set up in Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. The number is unlimited. The limit is reached when
your computer stops responding.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.6">2.6 Q06 Why does Sylpheed-Claws not delete my mails
when I press "delete"? I set a filter, and Sylpheed-Claws does not
filter. I moved a mail to a different mailbox and it did not move.</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You have to click the "execute" button.
The other solution: in the configuration settings
(Preferences -&gt; Summaries tab) you have to
check the "execute commands immediately" box.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.7">2.7 Q07 Can I set up special addresses/ports for my
mailserver / newsserver?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Yes, you can. In the configuration per account you
can specify the exact port addresses you want to use.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.8">2.8 Q08 Does Sylpheed-Claws have options for
threading messages?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Yes. You can switch it on and off in the Summary
Menu, just select "Thread View" or press Ctrl+T.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.9">2.9 Q09 Can I create multiple levels of subfolders
to store mail?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Absolutely. This is no problem.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.10">2.10 Q10 Why isn't Sylpheed-Claws sending my mail
out?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You need to create at least one account in order to
send. (This is a wonderful gotcha on LAN installs
with only a local mailbox feed).
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.11">2.11 Q11 How do I apply a patch after downloading
it?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Copy patch to sylpheed directory
Apply the patch:
</p>
<p><code>% patch -p0 &lt; some.patch</code>
</p>
<p>Or, if it's gzipped:
</p>
<p><code>% gzip -dc some.patch.gz | patch -p0</code>
</p>
<p>Run <code>./autogen.sh</code>, remove the generated <code>/config.cache</code>
file (unless you want to install in prefix
<code>/usr/local</code>).
Run <code>./configure</code> with the appropriate options and
then <code>make</code>.
(Text as found on the Sylpheed patches page.)
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.12">2.12 Q12 How do I compile in support for compface
pictures?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You have to have a package called <code>libcompface</code>
installed, so this is available for compiling into
Sylpheed.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.13">2.13 Q13 How do I make my own compface image?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. The faces package contains a program called xbm2ikon script,
which converts a 48x48 xbm to the format suitable for
compface. Thanks to Jeff Dairiki, you can have a complete online course
in this. Visit <a href="http://www.dairiki.org/xface/">this page</a>
for the details.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.14">2.14 Q14 How can I tell my
browser/newsclient/other program to use Sylpheed as e-mail program?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. In the settings part of the program, write
<code>sylpheed --compose</code>
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.15">2.15 Q15 How do I enable GPG support in Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. When compiling Sylpheed, make sure you you have gpgme &gt;= 0.4.5
available before running the ./configure command.
When that completes successfully, there is a "privacy" section in the
Common preferences.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.16">2.16 Q16 Mutt does not recognize Sylpheed-Claws's
MH structure</a>
</h2>
<p>A. For this to work you need to use the "touch" command in every MH
folder. "touch" the file .xmhcache and Mutt should do just fine.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.17">2.17 Q17 Viewing a GIF file within Sylpheed-Claws
causes a segmentation fault.</a>
</h2>
<p>A. In case this happens, you can easily fix that by adding the
following to /etc/mime.types:
</p>
<p><code>image/gif gif</code>
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.18">2.18 Q18 How can I make Sylpheed-Claws notify me
when new mail arrives?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. For this you can do several things:
</p>
<p>* Look at the Sylpheed patch page at <a
 href="http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/sylpheed/">http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/sylpheed/</a>
for a new mail patch.
</p>
<p>* Download Gkrellm or a similar program that is able to notify you
of new incoming mail. Gkrellm is available at <a
 href="http://www.gkrellm.net">the Gkrellm page</a></p>
<h2><a name="ss2.19">2.19 Q19 Can I use a spell checker with Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Yes. You can use aspell for this if it is compiled in.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="ss2.20">2.20 Q20 How can I make Sylpheed-Claws send my
compface image in the mails?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. In the Configuration menu, Preferences for current account, Send
tab, check Add user-defined header and press Edit button. A dialog
appears, add a header named "X-Face" and fill the value field with your
face data. Note that if you paste the data from a terminal into the
field some spurious newlines can be added, and these can mangle your
face, be careful.
