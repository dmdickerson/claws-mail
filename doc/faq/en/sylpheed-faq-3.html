<h2><a name="s3">3. Sylpheed-Claws FAQ - Interface</a></h2>
<h2><a name="ss3.1">3.1 Q01 How do I make Sylpheed-Claws display my
language?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You have to set some environment variables such as
<code>LANG,LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES</code> to your local language.
Usually <code>LANG</code> (or <code>LC_ALL</code>) is sufficient.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.2">3.2 Q02 I don't like the default font. Can I change
that?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Yes. In Configuration-&gt;preferences under the
"Display" tab.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.3">3.3 Q03 There are too many columns in the message
list!!</a>
</h2>
<p>A. In Configuration-&gt;preferences under the
"Display" tab you can press the button "Set display
item of summary". That pops up a screen with all the
options you can show or leave out of the message
list.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.4">3.4 Q04 Can I use a different editor to write my
mails?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You can. In Configuration-&gt;common preferences under
the "Other" tab you can define your editor of choice.
Remember, if you want to use a command line editor
like vi or emacs, to write the name of the shell
(term, term, rxvt) with the -e parameter in front of
the editor. E.g.: <code>rxvt -e vi %s</code>
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.5">3.5 Q05 How to change the font size in the Sylpheed-Claws
interface?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You can set the GTK+ font by <code>~/.gtkrc</code>, or
<code>~/.gtkrc.mine</code>,
(which is included by <code>~/.gtkrc</code>).
For example:
<code>style "default"
{
font =
"-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
"
}
widget_class "*" style "default"</code>
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.6">3.6 Q06 Sylpheed-Claws saves my outgoing mail (in
Outbox). Can I make it stop doing that?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. In Configuration-&gt;preferences there's a
checkbox "Save sent message to outbox". Uncheck it,
and it's solved.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.7">3.7 Q07 How can I change the key-bindings
(hot-keys) in Sylpheed-Claws?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. That is very simple. Suppose you want to assign a
shortcut key to a function, e.g. sending all mail
out should start when you press Ctrl-Y. Click the
Message' menu and move the mouse over "Send all
messages". Now you press Ctrl-Y. Immediately the menu
text is updated and the function is in place. Please
note that a previous function that Ctrl-Y was
assigned to, will no longer have a shortcut key. If
you want to remove the key binding, do the same
thing, but press the "delete" key on the menu-item.
Then the key binding is removed.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.8">3.8 Q08 Can I close windows without the mouse?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. Of course!! Not all windows, but by pressing ESCape,
you can close the addressbook, the window of viewing
a mail-source (message-&gt;view source), the window of
viewing the headers, and several others. Just give
it a try and you will find all of them.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.9">3.9 Q09 Can I change the way the date is displayed
in the message summary?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. As of 0.4.65 you can. The options are:
%y = year in numbers %m = month in number
%d = day in numbers %c = date/time for locale
%A = full weekday name %a = short month name
%B = full month name %b = short month name
%H = hours in 24-clock %I = hours in 12-clock
For more information go to the configuration menu,
select Common preferences / Display and move the
mouse cursor over the input box for the date display
format.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.10">3.10 Q10 Why can't I see the compface pictures?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You need to enable displaying of the header pane in the
general preferences
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.11">3.11 Q11 I still can't see the pictures. Why not?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You may not have compiled in Compface support. See Q11
in the Installation/Configuration section.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.12">3.12 Q12 Why does the URL Launcher not launch my
webbrowser?</a>
</h2>
<p>A. You need to double-click the url.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.13">3.13 Q13 Attachments with spaces in the name won't
open!</a>
</h2>
<p>A. When you try to launch a helper application, like an image
viewer, with an attachment that has spaces in the name, put quotes
around the %s
parameter. Example: gedit '%s'
