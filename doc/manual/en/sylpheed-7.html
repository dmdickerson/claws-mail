<h2><a name="s7">7.</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc7">Dialogs and views</a></h2>
<p>The appearance of the Sylpheed windows is controlled by
a Gtk+ theme (as Sylpheed is based on the Gtk+ toolkit).
Read the Gtk+ or your distribution documentation to find
how to change the Gtk+ theme.</p>
<h2><a name="ss7.1">7.1</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc7.1">Folder view</a>
</h2>
<p>The folder view shows you all the mail folders that you have
created, in a tree-like structure. If you want to see the messages in a
specific folder, just click the name of the folder once, and in the
summary view (2) you can see the messages in the selected mail folder.</p>
<p>When you see a + sign in front of a folder name, that means the
folder branch of that part of the tree is 'collapsed'. You can expand
that part by clicking the + sign. In that same manner you can also
collapse the - sign in front of an expanded branch of the folder tree.</p>
<p>The folder pane can be resized be dragging (left mouse button down)
the handle found on the right of the folder view.</p>
<p>The folder window can be detached from the main Sylpheed window
by selecting the menu action: <code>View -&gt; Separate folder tree</code>.
When exiting the current state of the folder window (attached or
detached) is saved to be restored when re-starting Sylpheed.
To re-attach the folder window, de-select the menu entry.</p>
<p>The folder view's columns are the name of the folder, count of new
messages, count of unread messages, total count of messages. If some of
these columns are useless to you, you can disable them via the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">View/Set displayed columns/in Folder list</span>
menu.</p>
<h3>Special folders:</h3>
<p><i>Draft:</i> here you store messages that you want to send out more
often, or you want to work on some more. Using the 'reedit' option from
the message menu, you can edit the message further.</p>
<p><i>Trash:</i> in here all your deleted messages go. Depending on the
common preferences setting, this box is or is not emptied when you end
Sylpheed.</p>
<p><i>Sent:</i> in here are saved the messages you send (enabled by a
common preference setting and the folder can be changed by an account
preference setting).</p>
<p><i>Queue:</i> this folder contains the composed messaged waiting to
be sent (with Sylpheed message sending can be delayed).</p>
<h2><a name="ss7.2">7.2</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc7.2">Summary view</a>
</h2>
<p>The summary pane can show you many things. You can select what you
want to see from the View menu, selecting the option "Set displayed
columns/in Message list". A list of all options is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number: shows the MH number of the message</li>
  <li>Score: the score of the message, as set by filtering rules</li>
  <li>Locked: shows if the message is locked</li>
  <li>Mark: shows if the message is marked.</li>
  <li>Status: shows if the message is read or not</li>
  <li>Attachment: shows MIME attachments</li>
  <li>From: who sent the message</li>
  <li>To: who received the message</li>
  <li>Subject: what the message is about</li>
  <li>Date: the date of sending by the sender</li>
  <li>Size: the size of the entire message including attachments</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>You can sort the summary view in many ways, by clicking the button
that is above the column. Click once to sort going up (a-z), click once
more to sort going down (z-a).</p>
<p>If you think the size of a column is not right, you can adjust that
by placing the mouse cursor next to the button of the column you want
to adjust, press mousebutton1 (left button) and drag the column to the
width you want it to have.</p>
<p>Select a message by clicking on it with the mouse. Once the summary
pane has the focus of the program, you can also move up and down in the
list through the cursor keys, or pressing "p"(revious) and "n"(ext) as
in Pine, and more: you can define shortcuts in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">View/Go to/</span> menu.</p>
<h2><a name="ss7.3">7.3</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc7.3">Message view</a>
</h2>
<p>In the message view you can read the message that you selected in
the summary pane. If you entered the summary pane without selecting a
message, the message view will be empty. At the top of the message view
some info is presented about the message you are reading, as well as
some statistics on the selected folder.</p>
<p>You can scroll up and down in the message by using the arrow keys
(after clicking inside the message), or by using the scrollbar.</p>
<p>The size of the message and summary views can be adjusted by
dragging
(with the left mouse button down) the handle that appears between
the two panes.</p>
<p>The small arrow located just below the summary pane scrollbar can
be used to detach the message view. When clicked, the summary view
is extended down to the bottom of the Sylpheed window, and the messages
are displayed is a separate window (when you double click them in the
summary pane). The message window
can be restored below the summary one by clicking again the small arrow.</p>
<p>At the right of the message, you can see the differents parts of it
- the message, the body, and if applicable, the attachments it has.
Clicking on the various parts show them; if there's an attachment
Sylpheed can't handle, you'll be able to open it using an external
application.
</p>
<h2><a name="ss7.4">7.4</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc7.4">Quick search</a>
</h2>
The quick search is located between the Summary view and the message
view. You can show it, or hide it, using the magnifying glass button at
the left of the status. You can then use the quicksearch in various
ways:<br>
Using the selector at the left, you can choose between Subject, From,
To, and Extended. <span style="font-style: italic;">Subject, From and
To</span> searches in the relevant field, while <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Extended </span>is more powerful,
allowing all kinds of searches, like 's blah' to match blah in the
subject, 'C john' to match mails sent to john, but can also match on
message age, size, status, and much more. All the possible symbols are
listed when clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extended
symbols</span> button. Finally, the selector lets you specify if you
want to search only in the current folder or recursively: sub-folders
of the current folders can be searched too. <br>
When you hit Enter in the search field, the summary view will be
trimmed to display only matching messages. <br>
As the quicksearch doesn't reset itself when you change folders, you
can sometimes get the impression of an empty folder which shouldn't be
that empty. In this case, don't forget to click on the Quicksearch's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Clear </span>button.<br>
