<h2><a name="ss6.5">6.5</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc6.5">Tools menu</a>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="ss6.6">6.6</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc6.6">Configuration
menu</a>
</h2>
<p>In the Configuration menu, clearly, you can set up Sylpheed-Claws
the way you want it to work and react.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Change current account:</i> here you can select what account
you want to use, to write a message.
If you have enabled the status bar (in the view menu),
the name of the current account is shown in the bottom
right corner of the Sylpheed window (in the status bar)
and can be changed by a click on it (then a menu appears
and lists all your accounts).</li>
  <li><i>Preferences for current account:</i> here you can set the
specifics for the account you are currently using. Should mail be
deleted after fetching, what is the server it comes from, etc.
Basically it is the same dialog form as shown in setting up a new
account.</li>
  <li><i>Create new account:</i> here you name the account (each
account has a recognizable name), you set up your name and e-mail
address etc. You set up the type of server you access (POP4, IMAP4,
local mailbox, NNTP) and where the downloaded messages have to go
(default folder is the inbox). In the RECEIVE tab you select or
unselect options, in SEND you can set up how to send your messages. In
COMPOSE you can point to a specific signature file, and in ADVANCED you
can set up alternate ports for the server, if these exist. The PRIVACY
tab exists if the GPG plugin(s) are available, where you can specify
things like whether you always want to sign your messages. The SSL tab
exists if openssl support is available, and you can choose here to use
SSL for sending and/or receiving email, for an increased security.</li>
  <li><i>Edit accounts:</i> here you can select one of the accounts you
created, from a list, and edit the information about them. Note that
you cannot edit an account for which you are writing a message at the
same time. This to ensure data integrity.</li>
  <li><i>Preferences:</i> in this option you will be presented a dialog
in which you can select a number of tabs. Each tab represents a
specific set of settings in Sylpheed. In the next chapter, these dialog
options are explained in more detail.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Pre-processing:</span> these
are processing rules shared by all folders, and executed before each
folder's private processing rules.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Post-processing: </span>these
are processing rules shared by all folders, and executed after each
folder's private processing rules.</li>
  <li><i>Filtering:</i> this option shows you a dialog in which you can
set up the filtering rules that you want Sylpheed to process on
receiving new e-mails. You first specify on which part(s) of the e-mail
Sylpheed has to check, and then you tell Sylpheed what to do. You can
move the message to a different directory (including trash to get rid
of spam mail). Selecting the destination folder is possible through a
browser window that comes up when you press "Select...". Optionally,
you can give a name to filtering rules in order to find them back more
easily.<br>
    <p>When you press the "Add" button, the filter rule is added to the
list of rules. Do you select "Replace", then the selected rule is
replaced by the information of the setting entered. "Delete" in the end
will delete the selected filtering rule.</p>
    <p>Please note that you can set up more than one selection for a
rule, which can be "OR'd" or "AND'd". OR means that one of the two
selections will have to match for the rule to be executed. AND means
that both selections have to match before an action is performed.</p>
    <p>To the right of the selection rules you see buttons called Top,
Up, Down and Bottom. You can move rules up and down in the list. This
will often trigger different behaviour in the selections, so consider
the order in which you set the rules. Usually, putting the more general
rules towards the end, and the more precise ones towards the start,
gives better results.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Templates:</i> lets you create new message templates.
When composing a new message you can then use one
of the defined templates and insert it (or use it to
completely replace the content of your mail).
The templates can contain some special characters
that are replaced when the template is used in order
to create a dynamic text. Use the symbols button on
the templates definition window to see the list of
the available symbols.</li>
  <li><i>Actions:</i> lets you create new commands to be added to the
'Tools/Actions' menu. An action is a command that processes
the select part of a message, the message body or the complete
message file. It can be a background process, used as a filter
(reads, modifies and replaces a message),...</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Plugins:</span> In this window,
you'll be able to see the plugins you have loaded, and their
description. You'll be able to load or unload plugins based on what you
need. The various plugins preferences appear in their special tab of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Preferences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="ss6.7">6.7</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc6.7">Help menu</a>
</h2>
<p>This menu lets you look at the manual and FAQ of Sylpheed, and you
can also see the "about" window with some information about copyrights,
compiled-in features, etc.</p>
<h2><a name="ss6.8">6.8</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc6.8">Context menu</a>
</h2>
<p>You can pull up context menus (through clicking button2) for the
folder tree and the summary pane. (windows users: button2 is the right
mouse button.)</p>
<p>In the folder view you can add, rename and remove folders through
the context menu. You can also set the folder
properties, specify specific processing rules, empty trash, etc.</p>
<p>In the message summary you can do a host of things from the context
menu, like viewing message headers, opening a message in a separate
window (also possible by double clicking on a message), color-labelling
them, etc.</p>
