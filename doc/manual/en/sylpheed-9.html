<h2><a name="s9">9.</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc9">Composing Messages</a></h2>
<h2><a name="ss9.1">9.1</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc9.1">Composing a
New Message</a>
</h2>
<p>When you start writing a new message, you are presented a dialog in
which you can enter all kinds of information. In the From: line you
find a dropdown list. In there you can select the e-mail account you
want to use as the sending account.</p>
<p>In the To: / Cc: / Bcc: part, you write the e-mail address of the
receiver. You can enter several e-mail addresses, as long as they are
separated by commas. An important utility here is the button "Address".
When you click that, you see the address book. You can point at an
address, click the "To:", "Cc:" or "Bcc:" button, and Sylpheed will
place the address in the selected line. You can set various headers,
even undefined ones by overwriting the text contained in the header's
name.<br>
</p>
<p>In the Subject line you enter a short descriptive text what your
message will be about.</p>
<p>You can move between these lines by pressing TAB (to skip to the
next line) and SHIFT-TAB (to go back up). When you press TAB in the
last line, you will be moved to the message body.</p>
<p>Did you select a signature file in the settings for the active
account, it will be in the message text already. You can now write your
message. When you are done, you can click Send, Send later or Draft in
the toolbar. Send attempts to send the message immediately. Send later
will place it in the Queue folder, and Draft will place it in the
Drafts folder.</p>
<h2><a name="ss9.2">9.2</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc9.2">Replying to
a Message</a>
</h2>
<p>To reply to a message, you use the "reply" function. In Sylpheed you
activate this through either the "Reply" button, or by pressing Alt-R.</p>
<p>A new message window will be created, with the e-mail address of the
recipient and the subject already set for you. Most of the things
described in Composing a new message are also applicable to this window.</p>
<h2><a name="ss9.3">9.3</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc9.3">Replying to
a Message with Quotation</a>
</h2>
<p>If you want to have Sylpheed quote the text you are replying to, you
need to go into the Configuration menu. There you select Common
preferences, go to the Compose tab, and check the "Quote message when
replying" box. There you can also edit the quotation mark (the mark put
in front of each quoted line in the reply mail) and the reply
attribution (which is placed in front of the reply text).</p>
<h2><a name="ss9.4">9.4</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc9.4">Forwarding
Messages</a>
</h2>
<p>Forwarding a message means: you send the entire message, including
headers (Sender address, date sent etc.) on to someone else. For this
you press the "Forward" button, or you press Ctrl-F. A new message
window is created, containing the text of the selected message. You can
then supply the name(s) of the recipient(s) of the message as in
composing a new message, perhaps add a few lines of text to the message
and send it on its way.</p>
