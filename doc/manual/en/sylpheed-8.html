<h2><a name="s8">8.</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc8">Sylpheed-Claws
configuration</a></h2>
<p>All the configuration settings of Sylpheed are accessible from
the <i>Configuration</i> menu and consist of common settings <i>(Preferences</i>,
<i>Filtering</i>, <i>Template</i>s, <span style="font-style: italic;">Actions,
</span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Plugins</span>) and
account specific
settings.</p>
<p>With Sylpheed-Claws, there is no limit to the number of accounts
you can create. You can create new accounts for each of your
mail accounts, but also to change the default behaviour of Sylpheed. As
folders can be attached to accounts, the account
specific part of the configuration automatically change based
on the current folder (you can have a different signature when
replying to messages from different folders, for example).</p>
<h2><a name="ss8.1">8.1</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc8.1">Preferences</a>
</h2>
<p>The Common Preferences, found in the Configuration menu, controls
the window layout and the different options of the graphical
interface of Sylpheed. Depending on some compile time switches
(and on the availability of some extra libraries), some tabs
may be included (or not) in your version of Sylpheed. These tabs
are not listed here but are described (or will be described) in
the sections covering the optional features they control (like the
<i>Privacy</i> tab for the GnuPG interface).</p>
<h3>Receive tab</h3>
<p>In here you can set up how to receive messages.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can define a special program to pick up messages from the
default unix mailbox. Usually this is not used.</li>
  <li><i>Autocheck new mail</i>. When you check this option, Sylpheed
will check if there is new mail on the set interval.</li>
  <li><i>Check new mail on startup</i> means that Sylpheed will
immediately look for new mail on all the selected accounts when it
loads.</li>
  <li><i>Update all local folders after incorporation</i> is used to
force scanning of all folders after getting new mail. Used when you
have external programs putting new mails in folders.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Show receive dialog</span>
allows you to remove the window displayed when retrieving mails, which
can get in your way if retrieval happens where you're composing a mail,
for example.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Don't popup error dialog </span>is
used to specify when to show errors. The advantage of not showing
errors on automatic retrieval, for example, is that it doesn't block
until you click Ok afterwards.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Close receive dialog when
finished</span> does what it says :)</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Run command when new mail
arrives</span> allows you to specify some command to run after
incorporation. You can </li>
</ul>
<h3>Send tab</h3>
<p>In here you can set up how to send messages.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sent messages can be saved in the outbox (<i>Sent</i>
folder), the name of the outbox folder can be specified
for each account (see the account setting section).</li>
  <li>If you want to be asked for confirmation when you click Send, you
can check <span style="font-style: italic;">Confirm before sending
queued messages.</span> This avoids sending by mistake.</li>
  <li>For the same reasons as the receive dialog, you can choose to
hide the <span style="font-style: italic;">send dialog.</span></li>
  <li>The outgoing codeset selection can be changed to force
the definition of the character set used in sent mails.
The default and recommended value is <i>automatic</i>,
so Sylpheed determines the codeset when sending each
message. This can be overriden in each message.</li>
  <li>You can also force the transfer encoding, in case you use an SMTP
server known for breaking plain text emails...</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Compose tab</h3>
<p>Controls the composition window's behaviour..</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Writing </span>sub-tab,
you can choose various defaults when replying, and whether you want to
automatically save composed mails from time to time. If <i>Automatically
select account(...)</i> is set,
the account used when replying to a message is automatically
selected based on the folder the original message is in (as you
were already told, accounts can be attached to folders).
  </li>
  <li>In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Quoting<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span></span>
sub-tab, you can choose what the predefined contents of the reply
window will look like.</li>
  <li>In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wrapping</span>
sub-tab, you can choose how you prefer the editor to behave. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Wrap on input</span> automatically puts
line breaks after the wrap width has been reached, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">wrap before sending</span> does it once
before sending; <span style="font-style: italic;">Wrap quotation</span>
reworks the included quotations so that they're not too wide, but don't
look broken either. <span style="font-style: italic;">Wrap pasted text</span>
lets you specify if you want what you paste from elsewhere to be
wrapped or not.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p></p>
<h3>Message view tab</h3>
<p>In here you can control the message display options of Sylpheed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Text options:</span></li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Display header pane </span>adds
a static header to the message with the most important informations
like <span style="font-style: italic;">From, To, Subject</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Display short headers</span>
adds that directly in the body, where it can be selected and quoted.
You can also <span style="font-style: italic;">Edit</span> the headers
you want included.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Render HTML messages as text</span>
strips the HTML messages some people send to their bare contents, <br>
    </li>
    <li>making them readable.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Colors </span>lets you define
the colors you prefer for various colored parts of the interface.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Image viewer </span>sets the
defaults for viewing images (display them or not, scaled or not).</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">External programs </span>lets
you specify what should be used to open links, texts, images, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Display tab</h3>
<p>In here you can the general appearance of Sylpheed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

 style="font-style: italic;">Translate header names</span></span>
localizes headers like From, To, ...</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Display unread number next to
folder </span>puts the number of unread mails in the folder name,
allowing you to see them even without the dedicated columns.</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Display sender using address
book</span> uses the name stored in your address book rather than the
one specified in the email, matching on the email address. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Warning</span>, this feature slows down
opening of big folders, especially with a big addressbook.</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Thread using subject</span>

dialog</span> allows you to get more control on what sylpheed does when
you reach the last unread mail in the folder.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Fonts: </span>You can change
the font used to display the messages. Pressing
the button next to the font name field will open the font selection
window, then you can select among all the available fonts.<span

<p></p>
<h2><a name="ss8.2">8.2</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc8.2">Setting up
an account/changing an account</a>
</h2>
<p>In order to set up an account in Sylpheed-Claws, in the <i>Configuration</i>
menu you select <i>Create new account</i>. If you want to change the
settings of an existing account and this account is the current
one, in the <i>Configuration</i> menu select <i>Preferences for
current account</i>, otherwise select <i>Edit accounts...</i>.
There you select the account you want to change. After that you press <i>edit</i>.
Then a dialog appears in which you can enter or update the following
areas:</p>
<h3><a name="Basic"></a> Basic tab</h3>
<p>In the "Basic" tab you name the account. This is to make identifying
the account easier. The name is then used in the <i>Change current
account</i>
part of the <i>Configuration</i> menu, or in menu found in the lower
right corner of the main window (used to quickly switch to another
account).</p>
<p>Choose a name that tells something about the account, like the name
of the ISP, mailbox or news-server you are setting up. You can select
this account to be the default account ("Set as default").
The default account can also be defined from the <i>Edit accounts</i>
window (toggle the <i>D</i> column next to the account name).</p>
<p>Enter your name and e-mail address, and if you have one, the
organization that you use Sylpheed for.
In the Protocol box you select the type of service that this account
will be using. The flavors you can choose are: <i>POP3</i><i></i>, <i>IMAP4</i>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">News (NNTP)</span><i></i> , <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Local mbox file, </span>or<i>None (SMTP
only)</i>.</p>
<p>For POP3 and IMAP services you can then specify the server where
your mail is stored. Details about this name, and also the name that
goes into the field for <i>SMTP server (send)</i> should be given to
you by your ISP.</p>
<p>For a local unix mailbox, the <i>Server for receiving</i> is
disabled, since the mail will be received for you.</p>
<p>The fields for <i>User ID</i> and <i>Password</i> will also be
disabled for accounts that do no deal with POP3, IMAP or News services.
Otherwise you can enter the login name and password for the&nbsp;
server with your ISP here. Usually these are the same as your login
name and password to access the dial-in service, but this is not
standard. If in doubt, contact the helpdesk of your ISP.</p>
<h3>Passwords:</h3>
<p>The password is not printed in the entry field (replaced by stars)
and
is stored with a little obfuscation in the Sylpheed configuration
files. The
Sylpheed
configuration directory (&nbsp;/.sylpheed) is only readable by 'owner',
and
not by 'group' and 'other', do not change these access rights. Do not
consider the password safe if you aren't the administrator of the
machine either - this goes for every software by the way.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Receive"></a> Receive tab</h3>
<p>The <i>Receive</i> tab is only used for POP3, IMAP and News
accounts. <br>
</p>
<p>For POP3, you
specify if the mails that were successfully retrieved should be removed
from the server. You can also tell Sylpheed to get all the messages
there, not only the ones you already received (in case you leave your
messages on the server).
You can choose to leave the messages on the server during a selectable
number of days (then remove them).<br>
You can also define a limit for the size of the messages to
download. Any message bigger than this limit will be&nbsp;
downloaded up to the limit, and you'll be able to get the rest of it
via the message view (or not get it).</p>
<p>For IMAP4, you can choose which kind of authentication to use (ask
your ISP, or try Automatic). <br>
</p>
<p>For News, you can choose what is the maximum numbers of new messages
to download.</p>
<p>You can also choose to filter messages on receiving, if not
set, the messages are only filtered when you use the filter
entry of the Tools menu.</p>
<p>The default inbox defines the folder that receives the incoming
(and not filtered) messages for this account.
You can define a different folder as inbox for each of your
accounts.</p>
<p>If the <i>Get all checks for messages on this account</i> is turned
off, when using the <i>Get all</i> menu entry (or toolbar button)
this account will not be checked. To check for new mails for
this account, you must select the account, then use the <i>Get</i>
toolbar button (or menu entry).</p>
<h3><a name="Send"></a> Send tab</h3>
<p>In the <i>Send</i> tab you can define the settings that apply to
sending mails.</p>
<p>You can choose to add the date field to the messages you send,
generate a unique message identifier, or add custom header
fields.</p>
<h3>X-face pictures:</h3>
<p>The user defined header field should be set up to contain your
X-face picture.
Thanks to Jeff Dairiki, you can have a complete online course in this.
Visit <a href="http://www.dairiki.org/xface/">this page</a> for the
details.</p>
<p>If your SMTP server needs authentication, define the user ID and
password to use in this tab. You can also choose to first authenticate
with
POP3 before sending if the receiving server is POP3.</p>
<h3><a name="Compose"></a> Compose tab</h3>
<p>In the <i>Compose</i> tab you can define your signature file,
choose to always copy someone when sending mails (you can
choose to always copy your boss, or yourself), and define the
Reply-To field for the current account.</p>
<h3><a name="Privacy"></a> Privacy tab</h3>
<p>This tab is only available when Sylpheed has been compiled
with GPGME and GNUPG (for signature and encryption).</p>
<p>With this tab you can choose the keys to use when signing
or encrypting mails for this account, whether you want your messages to
be signed by default, etc.</p>
<h3><a name="SSL"></a> SSL tab</h3>
<p>This tab is only available when Sylpheed has been compiled
with openSSL.</p>
<p>With this tab you can choose whether to use SSL on the receiving and
sending servers. STARTTLS is used to connect to the normal, unencrypted
port, and to start encryption later. This is not supported by all
servers, but can be handy for passing misconfigured firewalls.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="Advanced"></a> Advanced tab</h3>
<p>The Advanced tab contains some settings you normally do
not need to change (unless you really know what you are
doing).</p>
<p>You can change the default SMTP or POP3 ports used when
connecting to your mail server, define a domain name to
use when sending a mail. Some ISP (or mail relays) reject
mails without a valid domain name.</p>
<p>The default folders for the sent messages, drafts and
trash can be defined here. If not changed the current account
will use the default folders.</p>
<h3>Attaching accounts to folders</h3>
<p>Pressing the right mouse button over a folder (in the folder pane),
and selecting the <i>Properties</i> entry will open the folder
properties
form. In this form, in the <i>General</i> tab you can see (but not
modify)
the folder name and the corresponding directory path (relative to the
mail
directory). In the <i>Compose</i> tab:</p>
<p>you can select the account, choose to apply this setting also to
the sub-folders.
You can also force the address used when sending mail (to force a
mailing
list address, for example), choose to send a copy of the sent mails
to a list of addresses different from the default one defined for the
selected account.</p>
<h3>Using accounts in the real life</h3>
<p>Accounts can, of course be used to retrieve mails from different
ISPs,
separate your personal and professional messages, but also to make your
life easier.
You can define different accounts just to change your address (as
sender),
your signature, change the sent folder, etc...
Here is a summary of the account specific settings, feel free to
find your own use for them:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sender name, address and organization. Signature, extra header
fields.</li>
  <li>Leave or remove message from server (usefull for debug).</li>
  <li>Incoming mails filtering and size limit.</li>
  <li>Default field (<i>Reply-To</i>:, <i>Cc:</i>, <i>Bcc:</i>).</li>
  <li><i>Draft</i>, <i>Trash</i> and <i>Sent</i> folders.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>By attaching accounts to folders, you can control all these settings
on a folder basis, but you can also change the <i>To:</i>, <i>Cc:</i>,
<i>Bcc:</i>, and <i>Reply-To:</i> for each folder (overrides the
account
settings).</p>
