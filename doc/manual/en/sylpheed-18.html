Fonts on Menu, etc.</a>
</h2>
<p>If you want to change the font that shows the menu of Sylpheed-Claws, this
is controlled by the window manager that you are using. You have to go
into the setup of the window manager (KDE, Gnome, XFCE) and change the
font to your desired one.</p>
<p>Changing the font of the views of Sylpheed-Claws is done by selecting
"Common preferences" in the Configuration menu. There you select the
"Display" tab, and in the first section of the window you can browse
the fonts available on your computer.</p>
<h2><a name="ss18.4">15.4</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc18.4">Changing
Key Binding of Short-Cut Key</a>
</h2>
<p>Sylpheed-Claws' graphical interface is based on GTK. This means that it
is very simple to change the key binding (shortcut key, hotkey) for
menu items. If you are used to a certain key combination from another
program, you can tell Sylpheed-Claws to use that same key combination.</p>
<p>The procedure is very simple. Suppose you want to change the key
binding for getting new mail (message menu) from Alt-I to Ctrl-M.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the message menu with the mouse or by pressing Alt-M</li>
  <li>Select the "get new mail" option (do not click it, this will
activate the function!). If you use the mouse, just move the mouse
cursor over the option.</li>
  <li>Now you press Ctrl-M. You will immediately see the new key
combination appear on the menu.</li>
</ul>
Congratulations, you have just changed a key binding. This way you can
change all the options that you want. Do note that it is best to use
just the alt, shift and ctrl key combinations. Several functions within
Sylpheed-Claws are called up by one-key actions which are programmed in.
