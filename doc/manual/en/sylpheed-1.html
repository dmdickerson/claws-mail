<h2><a name="ss1.1">1.1</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc1.1">Introduction
to Sylpheed-Claws.</a>
</h2>
<p>Sylpheed-Claws is a fast e-mail and news client. It will run on just
about any Linux or Unix compliant system.</p>
<p>The power of Sylpheed-Claws is that it is
</p>
<ul>
  <li>light on resources</li>
  <li>very fast</li>
  <li>intuitive for most people</li>
  <li>easy to work with</li>
  <li>loaded with features</li>
  <li>graceful and sophisticated in its interface</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="ss1.2">1.2</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc1.2">Interface</a>
</h2>
<p>The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail
clients for Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The
interface is also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and
almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.</p>
<p>The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it
together with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can
also utilize fetchmail or/and procmail, external programs for receiving
(like inc or imget), and other storage backends using plugins.</p>
<h2><a name="ss1.3">1.3</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc1.3">Main

<h2><a name="ss1.4">1.4</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc1.4">Methods for
managing messages</a>
</h2>
<p>There are several ways to manage messages. The best known is <code>not
at all.</code></p>
<p>Too many people receive lots of e-mails and just let them end up in
the INBOX folder. Which after a while becomes unmanageable. Try to
locate that one mail about an important event you got 5 days ago, in a
mailbox that has over 5000 messages in it. Even when sorted on date, it
might take you a tremendous time to locate it.</p>
<p>For this there are <code>mailfolders and mailboxes.</code></p>
<p>When you read on in this manual, you will learn about creating
mailboxes and also folders that can contain more mailboxes. What are
these good for?</p>
<p>Overview. Simple as that. In different mailboxes you can store
different kinds of mails. Suppose you are a member of a kiting club.
And you get at least 30 e-mails per day from that club. The smart thing
to do now is to create a separate mailbox for these mails. So when an
e-mail comes in from the kiting club, you can move it to the kiting
club mailbox. That way you know that you have all your kiting e-mails
in one place.</p>
<p>Tedious, you say? To move 30 mails a day to that box, when they come
in at random moments? You bet that is a tedious job. You can be certain
that you will miss that very important one about transport to the
kiting ground where you will have the contest of biggest and most
beautiful kite!</p>
<p>Well, also for this there is a solution. Those are called <code>filters</code>.</p>
<p>Filters can automate the process of moving e-mails to new locations.
Further on in this manual you will also learn about setting up filters,
so you do not have to move these kiting e-mails to the kiting club
mailbox.</p>
<h3>Okay, so what is the difference between a mailbox and a mailfolder?</h3>
<p>This is actually the exact same thing as you do on your harddisk.
You create directories in which you can put files and more directories.</p>
<p>In the case of Sylpheed, you can create a mailbox in which you can
put more mailboxes that somehow belong together. For example, you could
create a mailbox (folder) that contains the mailboxes for all the
mailing lists you belong to.</p>
<p>A word of clarification is perhaps in need here. In Sylpheed, a
maillbox is nothing more than a directory. And in a directory you can
create a new directory. But also files. And Sylpheed-Claws stores each e-mail
in a separate file on disk.
An example of how a mailbox tree could look is</p>
<p>As you can see, there is no real limit to the way you can set up
your mailboxes. As long as you have diskspace available, you can create
mailboxes and mailboxes within mailboxes.</p>
<p>Of course, you should observe some common sense when you start
creating mailboxes. To keep all mail in one place is not a good idea,
but to create a maze of mailboxes is not a good idea either!</p>
<h2><a name="ss1.5">1.5</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc1.5">Features
for the future</a>
</h2>
<p>This is a special chapter. As with all open source programs, many
features can be requested by you, the user of Sylpheed-Claws. The best
way to join in on the talks is to join one of the mailing lists on
Sylpheed. For this, you can turn to the Information section of this
manual and read up on how to join a mailing list.</p>
