<h2><a name="s12">10.</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12">Address Book</a></h2>
<p>In the address book, accessible through Shift-Ctrl-A, the
Addressbook button, or through the "Tools" menu, you store e-mail
addresses of the people and places you want to write more often.</p>
<p>If the options have been compiled into Sylpheed, the
address book can connect to a LDAP server for address
lookup, and you can use the address book stored on your
Palm PDA.</p>
<h2><a name="ss12.1">10.1</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12.1">Adding
and Deleting Addresses</a>
</h2>
<p>Adding an address to the address book is quite easy too. Rightclick
the folder or group you want to add the address to, select "new
address" and fill in the dialog that comes up. You can also directly
click the Add button in the address book window, and the dialog comes
up. In this case the address is moved into the folder/group that is
selected at the moment of adding.</p>
<p>In the "Basic data" tab, you can fill the first
and last name and provide a nickname. The "Display name"
will be used by the "Name" column of the address book
window.</p>
<p>In the "E-Mail address" tab, fill the address field
and use the "Add" button to add the address to the list.
An alias can also be assigned to this address and used
when searching for an address.
Several addresses can be assigned to the same person
in your address book by repeating the sequence described
above. The addresses can then be sorted by using the "Move up" and
"Move down" buttons. The address on the top
will be the first one listed in the address book main window.</p>
<p>Deleting an address is equally simple. Find the address, click it
once, and press the Delete button.</p>
<h2><a name="ss12.2">10.2</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12.2">Folders
and Groups</a>
</h2>
<p>You can use groups and folders to organize your address
book into categories, hierarchies and aliases.
The folders are used to generate a hierarchical organization
and contain the actual addresses, while the groups are
used to group together addresses that lives in separate
folders.</p>
<p>Sounds complicated, so let's see an example: consider
your workmates, they are arnaud (arnaud@company.com),
sandra (sandra@company.com), xavier (xavier@company.com)
and the chief, helene (helene@company.com). You can
create a folder named <code>myGroup</code>, create the entries
for all your workmates in this folder. Now you can create one
groupe named <code>jokes</code> that includes all but the boss
to use when sending your daily jokes, another one named
<code>team</code> that includes everybody for the usual group
(serious) communication, and a third group named
<code>reports</code> that includes the boss, and the one working with
you on some projects for the weekly reports.</p>
<p>To generate this kind of addresses organization
you only need to create the entries once, then when
creating groups you can select among the existing entries
to fill the groups.</p>
<p>The address book, like the mail folders, can be expanded into an
entire tree of sections. For this you right-click on the folder where
you want to add a new folder, and select "new folder". Then you can
enter a descriptive name for the folder, click Ok, and your folder is
created.</p>
<p>In this same way you can create a new group in a folder. Right-click
on the folder, select "new group", enter a name for it, and that's it.</p>
<p>The group settings window pops up in order to fill the group
with addresses. Use the two arrows to add to or remove from
the group the selected address.
Once the group contains the list of addresses you want it to
contain, click the "OK" button to close the window.</p>
<h2><a name="ss12.3">10.3</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12.3">Combination
with Message Composition Window</a>
</h2>
<p>You can either enter the first letters of an address
(or alias) in the <code>To:</code> or <code>Cc:</code> field
of the composition window and press the TAB key to
let Sylpheed-Claws do the completion or open the address book,
select addresses from there and use the <code>To:</code>
and <code>Cc:</code> buttons to copy the selected addresses
into the corresponding fields of the composition window.</p>
<p>When using the completion mode, when one or more address
matches the start you have entered, a dropdown list appears.
Select the correct address from this list and press enter
to complete the composition window's field.</p>
<p>In completion mode, the search is made on the E-mail
address and on the alias. The other fields of the
address book entry are not used (name, nickname,...).</p>
<p>When the address book is opened, if you select a group,
using the <code>To:</code> or <code>Cc:</code> buttons will
copy all the addresses of the selected group into the
corresponding field of the composition window.</p>
<p>Using our previous example, you can select the <code>jokes</code>
group when sending you morning jokes, and the <code>reports</code>
one when sending your weekly reports...</p>
<h2><a name="ss12.4">10.4</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12.4">Using
your PDA addressbook (with Jpilot)</a>
</h2>
<p>Sylpheed-Claws can optionally use your PDA addressbook. This option is
available if you have compiled Sylpheed-Claws with the support of Jpilot.
For more details regarding the compilation of Sylpheed-Claws with (or
without)
optional features, see the <a href="sylpheed-4.html#compile_sylpheed">compilation
section</a>.</p>
<p>Sylpheed-Claws uses the Jpilot side copy of your address book, so you do
not need to put your PDA on the craddle to find an address (but do
not forget to synchronize).</p>
<p>In order to use your PDA's addressbook in Sylpheed, open the
addressbook
window, select the <i>JPilot</i> icon in the left tree view,
use the <i>File -&gt; New Jpilot</i> menu entry and choose a name for
this addressbook.
Define the name of the Jpilot addressbook file (usually in:
<code>~/.jpilot/AddressDB.pdb</code>) and press <i>OK</i>.
You can use one (or more) of the custom fields to store alternate
Email addresses for the same person.</p>
<p>Now you can browse your PDA addressbook. Sylpheed-Claws only has read
access to this addressbook, so you can't modify your PDA addressbook
from Sylpheed.</p>
<h2><a name="ss12.5">10.5</a> <a href="sylpheed.html#toc12.5">LDAP
server connection</a>
</h2>
<p>You can connect to an LDAP server by using the menu <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Book/new Server.</span> Choose a name for
it, put the correct hostname and port. The Search Base can often be
automatically retrieved from the server by using the [...] button at
the right of it. If it doesn't work, contact your sysadmin so that he
gives you the correct search base to use. It is mandatory, a bad search
base will cause all your search attempts to fail. If your LDAP server
requires authentication, fill that in the Extended tab. <br>
