THANKS
install.sh was originally based on the install.sh script written by Dylan
Schrader <dschrader@conception.edu>, and released under the GPL, as part
of his 'Attach to email' service Menu for Konqueror, version 0.6.13
<http://themes.kde.org/content/show.php?content=11234>, it has since been
heavily adapted.
