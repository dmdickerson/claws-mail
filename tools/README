* eud2gc.py

  WHAT IT DOES

  This python-script is a quick hack to convert an Eudora (v.3?) addressbook
  to vCard (GnomeCard) format.

  HOW TO USE IT

  You may do whatever you want with it! (Also regarding copying)

  However, the script is intended to use like this:

  			eud2gc.py <Eudora-addressbook-file> <Gnomecard-file>

  Be carefull not to overwrite your original GnomeCard.gcrd!
  (But of course you might want to add the converted stuff to it)

* filter_conv.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script provides easy conversion of your filtering rules
  form sylpheed's old filter system to the new filtering system used
  in sylpheed-claws. It reads 'filterrc' and outputs 'filteringrc'.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Move 'filter_conv.pl' to the $HOME/.sylpheed directory.
  From the $HOME/.sylpheed directory, issue the command:

        perl filter_conv.pl

  That's it, the new filtering system is now implemented with your
  previous rules applied.

* gif2xface.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script converts a monochrome (1 bit) 48x48 pixels GIF file
  into an X-Face graphic suitable for inclusion into custom headers of
  Sylpheed. An X-Face allows to quickly identify (or be identified as)
  the sender of a mail message in a xface-capable MUA (like sylpheed).

  HOW TO USE IT

  After obtaining the desired image for your X-Face you should:
    * scale it to 48x48 pixels (Image->Scale image on Gimp)
    * down color depth to b/w (Image->Mode->Indexed selecting "Use
      Black/White palette" and the desired dithering options (prior to
      indexing doing Image->Colors->Threshold allows you to select the
      b/w level if you don't want a dithered (dotty) image))
    * save file as non-interlaced GIF
  Then do:

      ./gif2xface < filename.gif > filename.xface

  In filename.xface will be the X-Face header ready to use.
  You can add a custom header in Sylpheed through Configuration->
  Preferences per account, "Send" tab, check "Add user-defined header"
  then "Edit..." if you want to add it via Sylpheed interface, or do

      echo "0:" `cat filename.xface` > ~/.sylpheed/customheaderrc

  if you want to create the custom headers file yourself (Warning: this
  method is valid only if you don't have any other custom header set or
  they will be lost!).

* ldif-to-xml.py

  WHAT IT DOES

  This python script converts the netscape ldif format address book to
  the sylpheed xml format.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Inside Netscape export your address book to a file.
  From the command line, execute:

      ./ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  In case of trouble, just invoke your python interpreter directly:

      python ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  Either way a file called addressbook.xml will be generated in the current
  directory. This xml file should be merged with or simply placed in the
  $HOME/.sylpheed directory.
