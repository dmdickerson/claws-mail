** multiwebsearch.pl **

  WHAT IT DOES
	This is an Actions script that allows you to search
	websites for the selected text. It uses the default
	Sylpheed-Claws browser as configured through Sylpheed
	-Claws' GUI and specified in ~/.sylpheed-claws/sylpheedrc,
	and a configuration file called multiwebsearch.conf.
	
  CONFIGURATION
  	The configuration file takes the following format:
	
	ALIAS|URL PART|URL PART
	
	ALIAS is a user-defined name; the first URL PART is the
	url before the search term; the second URL PART is
	optional and contains the remaining part of the url which
	comes after the search term. A sample configuration file
	is included.
	
  HOW TO USE IT
	Copy 'multiwebsearch.conf' to ~/.sylpheed-claws/
	
	Configure an Action:
	a) pre-configured website 
	   Command: multiwebsearch.pl --where="google" --what="%s"
	b) dynamic
	   Command: multiwebsearch.pl --where="%u" --what="%s"
	   
	In type a) "google" refers to one of the configured aliases,
	this Action will always search the website referred to by
	the alias "google".
	
	In type b) you will be presented with a dialog box into
	which you type one of your configured aliases

Address book conversion
-----------------------

* eud2gc.py

  WHAT IT DOES
	This python-script is a quick hack to convert an Eudora (v.3?)
	addressbook to vCard (GnomeCard) format.

  HOW TO USE IT
	You may do whatever you want with it! (Also regarding copying)
	However, the script is intended to use like this:

		eud2gc.py <Eudora-addressbook-file> <Gnomecard-file>

  	Be careful not to overwrite your original GnomeCard.gcrd!
  	(But of course you might want to add the converted stuff to it)

  Contact: Jeroen Versteeg <j.m.versteeg@student.utwente.nl>

* kmail2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script will convert an exported Kmail addressbook into a
  	Sylpheed-Claws addressbook. If your version of Kmail is 1.37 or
	greater and/or your version of KAddressBook is 3.1beta1 or greater,
	or this script mixes up your definitions and their related data, use
  	'kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl' instead.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed-claws at least once before running this script.)

	In Kmail's Address book choose '/File/Export List'. This will export
  	your Kmail address book data to a *.csv file.

  	If Sylpheed-Claws is running, close it.

  	From the command line, execute the following:
 
		perl kmail2sylpheed.pl --kmailfile=/path/to/addressbook.csv

  	Your Kmail address book data will now be contained in Sylpheed-Claws'
  	address book, under the name 'Kmail Address Book'.

  Contact: Paul Mangan <claws@thewildbeast.co.uk>
    

* kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl

  This script has been tested with Kmail 1.4.7 and KAddressBook 3.1beta1

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script will convert a Kmail address book that has been
  	exported in csv format into a Sylpheed-Claws address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed-claws at least once before running this script.)
  
  	Open Kmail's Addressbook, /File/Address Book
  	In Kmail's Addressbook choose '/File/Export/Export List...'. This 
  	will allow you to export your Kmail addressbook data to a *.csv file.

  	If Sylpheed-Claws is running, close it.

  	From the command line, execute the following:
 
		perl kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl --kmailfile=/path/to/addressbook.csv
	
  	You can also use --help to see usage instructions.

  	Your Kmail addressbook data will now be contained in Sylpheed-Claws'
  	addressbook, under the name 'Kmail address book'.

* outlook2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script converts an Outlook generated contact list into a 
  	Sylpheed-Claws XML address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
  	For text files:
	--------------
  	You must export Outlook Express contact list as TXT file, choosing
  	only "Name" and "Address" fields to export.

  	You must exit Sylpheed-Claws before converting the contact list.

  	From the command line, execute the following:

		outlook2sylpheed.pl fullpathname

	For csv files:
	-------------
	You must export Outlook contact list as CSV file, choosing ALL the
	fields available for exporting.

	You must exit Sylpheed-Claws before converting the contact list.

	From the command line, execute the following:

		outlook2sylpheed.pl --csv fullpathname

  LIMITATIONS
	For text files only works with fields described above. If you have 
	more complex examples send them to me, and I'll try to enhance the 
	script.

	For csv files you must export all fields (but only non empty fields
	are added to the created Sylpheed-Claws address book) and the number
	of fields expected is harcoded. Look for the $nboffields variable in
	the script and change its value if you are sure you exported all
	fields and script gives the 'unknown csv file format' error.

* tb2sylpheed

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script will convert an address book exported from The Bat! 
	into a Sylpheed-Claws address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed-claws at least once before running this script.)

  	If Sylpheed-Claws is running, close it.

  	Export The Bat! Address Book to CSV file format with all fields 
  	selected to YES and then start:

  		tb2sylpheed --tbfile=/full/path/to/thebat/addressbook.csv
 
  	The Bat! addressbook data will now be contained in Sylpheed-Claws'
  	addressbook, under the name 'The Bat! Address Book'.

  Contact: Urke MMI <urke@gmx.net>  


* vcard2xml.py

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This python script will convert an Evolution vCard into a Sylpheed-Claws
	address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed-claws at least once before running this script.)

  	If Sylpheed-Claws is running, close it.
	From the command line, execute the following:

  		vcard2xml.py source_file [destination_file]
 
  	When only <source_file> is specified it will overwrite (and
	create a backup of) the existing addressbook. 
	When both arguments are suplied it will create a new additional 
	addressbook named as <destination_file>.
	If the script encounters an error it will attempt to roll back
	the changes and restore the original files.

* gif2xface.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script converts a monochrome (1 bit) 48x48 pixels GIF file
  	into an X-Face graphic suitable for inclusion into custom headers of
  	Sylpheed-Claws. An X-Face allows to quickly identify (or be identified
	as) the sender of a mail message in a xface-capable MUA (like sylpheed
	-claws).

  HOW TO USE IT
	After obtaining the desired image for your X-Face you should:
    	  * scale it to 48x48 pixels (Image->Scale image on Gimp)
    	  * down color depth to b/w (Image->Mode->Indexed selecting "Use
      	    Black/White palette" and the desired dithering options (prior to
      	    indexing doing Image->Colors->Threshold allows you to select the
      	    b/w level if you don't want a dithered (dotty) image))
    	  * save file as non-interlaced GIF
  	Then do:

      		./gif2xface < filename.gif > filename.xface

  	In filename.xface will be the X-Face header ready to use.
  	You can add a custom header in Sylpheed-Claws through Configuration->
  	Preferences per account, "Send" tab, check "Add user-defined header"
  	then "Edit..." if you want to add it via Sylpheed -Claws interface, or do

      		echo "0:" `cat filename.xface` > ~/.sylpheed-claws/customheaderrc

  	if you want to create the custom headers file yourself (Warning: this
  	method is valid only if you don't have any other custom header set or
  	they will be lost!).
