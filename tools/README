* filter_conv.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script provides easy conversion of your filtering rules
  form sylpheed's old filter system to the new filtering system used
  in sylpheed-claws. It reads 'filterrc' and outputs 'filteringrc'.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Move 'filter_conv.pl' to the $HOME/.sylpheed directory.
  From the $HOME/.sylpheed directory, issue the command:

        perl filter_conv.pl

  That's it, the new filtering system is now implemented with your
  previous rules applied.

* ldif-to-xml.py

  WHAT IT DOES

  This python script converts the netscape ldif format address book to
  the sylpheed xml format.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Inside Netscape export your address book to a file.
  From the command line, execute:

      ./ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  In case of trouble, just invoke your python interpreter directly:

      python ldif-to-xml.py <path/filename>

  Either way a file called addressbook.xml will be generated in the current
  directory. This xml file should be merged with or simply placed in the
  $HOME/.sylpheed directory.
