Address book conversion
-----------------------

* eud2gc.py

  WHAT IT DOES
	This python-script is a quick hack to convert an Eudora (v.3?)
	addressbook to vCard (GnomeCard) format.

  HOW TO USE IT
	You may do whatever you want with it! (Also regarding copying)
	However, the script is intended to use like this:

		eud2gc.py <Eudora-addressbook-file> <Gnomecard-file>

  	Be careful not to overwrite your original GnomeCard.gcrd!
  	(But of course you might want to add the converted stuff to it)

* kmail2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script will convert an exported Kmail addressbook into a
  	Sylpheed addressbook. If your version of Kmail is 1.37 or greater
  	and/or your version of KAddressBook is 3.1beta1 or greater, or
  	this script mixes up your definitions and their related data, use
  	'kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl' instead.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed at least once before running this script.)

	In Kmail's Address book choose '/File/Export List'. This will export
  	your Kmail address book data to a *.csv file.

  	If Sylpheed is running, close it.

  	From the command line, execute the following:
 
		perl kmail2sylpheed.pl --kmailfile=/path/to/addressbook.csv

  	Your Kmail address book data will now be contained in Sylpheed's
  	address book, under the name 'Kmail Address Book'.

  Contact: Paul Mangan <claws@thewildbeast.co.uk>
    

* kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl

  This script has been tested with Kmail 1.4.7 and KAddressBook 3.1beta1

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script will convert a Kmail address book that has been
  	exported in csv format into a Sylpheed address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed at least once before running this script.)
  
  	Open Kmail's Addressbook, /File/Address Book
  	In Kmail's Addressbook choose '/File/Export/Export List...'. This 
  	will allow you to export your Kmail addressbook data to a *.csv file.

  	If Sylpheed is running, close it.

  	From the command line, execute the following:
 
		perl kmail2sylpheed_v2.pl --kmailfile=/path/to/addressbook.csv
	
  	You can also use --help to see usage instructions.

  	Your Kmail addressbook data will now be contained in Sylpheed's
  	addressbook, under the name 'Kmail address book'.

* outlook2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script converts an Outlook generated contact list into a 
  	Sylpheed XML address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
  	You must export Outlook Express contact list as TXT file, choosing
  	only "Name" and "Address" fields to export.

  	You must exit Sylpheed before converting the contact list.

  	From the command line, execute the following:

		outlook2sylpheed.pl fullpathname

  LIMITATIONS
	Only works with fields described above. If you have more complex
  	examples send them to me, and I'll try to enhance the script.

* tb2sylpheed

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script will convert an address book exported from The Bat! 
	into a Sylpheed address book.

  HOW TO USE IT
	(You must run sylpheed at least once before running this script.)

  	If Sylpheed is running, close it.

  	Export The Bat! Address Book to CSV file format with all fields 
  	selected to YES and then start:

  		tb2sylpheed --tbfile=/full/path/to/thebat/addressbook.csv
 
  	The Bat! addressbook data will now be contained in Sylpheed's
  	addressbook, under the name 'The Bat! Address Book'.

Mailbox conversion
------------------

* calypso_convert.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script imports mbox files that are exported by Calypso.
  	It recreates the folder structure by scanning the "X-CalypsoFolder"
  	header and reincludes the attachments referenced in the
  	"X-CalypsoHtmlBody" "X-CalypsoAccount" "X-Attachment" headers.
  
  HOW TO USE IT
	Export the Calypso mailbox by selecting "Save to archive" and check
  	the "Save attachments" box.
	
  	Edit the script to set following variables (at the top of the file):
 	   $mboxdir  : path to the exported mbox, e.g. 'Archive' or '.'
 	   $mboxfile : name of exported mbox, e.g. 'mail.txt'
 	   $outdir   : name of the MH folder to create, e.g. 'Calypso'
	   
 	 Run the script using
	 
    		perl calypso_convert.pl
		
  	Finally, import that folder by either selecting "New mailbox" or
  	moving it into your existing directory and recreate the folder
  	structure manually (contentmenu from folderview).

Other tools
-----------

* filter_conv.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script provides easy conversion of your filtering rules
  	form sylpheed's old filter system to the new filtering system used
  	in sylpheed-claws. It reads '~/.sylpheed/filterrc' and outputs 
  	'~/.sylpheed/matcherrc'.
  
  HOW TO USE IT
	Issue the following command from the 'tools' directory:

        perl filter_conv.pl

  	That's it, the new filtering system is now implemented with your
  	previous rules applied.

* newscache_clean.pl

  WHAT IT DOES AND WHY IT DOES IT
	This perl script cleans up in '$HOME/.sylpheed/newscache'. Currently
  	the newscache becomes littered with old directories and files - when
  	you subscribe to a newsgroup a sub-directory gets created for it in
  	~/.sylpheed/newscache/[nntpserver], should you unsubscribe from the 
  	group the sub-directory does not get deleted. Until this is done 
  	internally this script will take care of some tidying up.
  
  	This script removes directory trees of nntp servers that you no longer
  	have an account for. Where an account exists it removes directories
  	and files of those groups to which you are no longer subscribed.

  HOW TO USE IT
	Issue the following command from the 'tools' directory:
  
  		perl newscache_clean.pl
        
  	This script uses the File::Path module, if you don't already have it
  	installed, you can find it at the CPAN search site 
	<http://search.cpan.org>

* OOo2sylpheed.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script enables OpenOffice.org to send documents to sylpheed
  	as attachments.

  HOW TO USE IT
  	Start up OpenOffice.org.
  	Go to 'Tools/Options/OpenOffice.org/External Programs'
  	Enter the path to OOo2sylpheed.pl in the 'Program' box
  	or select it by clicking on the '...' button.

  	You can then use 'File/Send/Document as email' to launch sylpheed
  	(if not already launched) and open a new compose window with the
  	document attached.

  	Tested with OpenOffice.org version 1.0

* sylpheed-switcher

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This perl script is for users who like to move between the main
  	sylpheed branch and the claws branch. Because of some differences
  	between the stored options it is better IMO to use two separate
  	'.sylpheed' directory trees. Doing that manually could prove to
  	be tiresome, and so I've written this script to automate the task.

  	The first time you run this script you enter the full paths,
  	including the executable itself, to both the main version of
  	sylpheed and the claws version. This information is then stored
  	in a file in your $HOME directory called '.sylpheed-switcher'

  	During this initial set-up, your '~/.sylpheed' directory
  	is copied to '~/.sylpheed-main' and '~/.sylpheed-claws'.
  
  	When you run sylpheed via this script, your '~/.sylpheed' directory
  	is deleted and replaced with a symbolic link to either 
	~/.sylpheed-main' or '~/sylpheed-claws', depending on the option you 
	choose. (On subsequent usage the symbolic link is deleted and replaced 
	with a new symbolic link).

  HOW TO USE IT
  	Initial set-up
  	Enter the full paths to the executable, including the executable itself,
  	example:
  
 		./sylpheed-switcher --claws-path=/usr/local/bin/sylpheed 
		--main-path=/usr/bin/sylpheed
        
  	After the initial set-up, use the following:
  
  		./sylpheed-switcher --claws	(to run sylpheed-claws)
        	./sylpheed-switcher --main	(to run sylpheed main)
        
  	Additionally you can append --debug to run in debug mode.
  	Use --help for more info.  	
 
  	This script uses the File::Path and Getopt::Long modules, if you don't
	already have them installed, you can find them at the CPAN search site 
  	<http://search.cpan.org>

* update-po

  WHAT IT DOES
  	This script is a message catalog translator's tool, it updates the .po 
  	files named on the command line.

  HOW TO USE IT
	This script needs to be copied to and run from the 'po' directory.
  
		./update-po lang.po lang2.po ...

  	to update one or more <yourlang>.po files from the sourcecode files
 	 named in POTFILES.in. The old .po file is save in a .po.old file.

  	For example, when you want to update fr.po, run ./update-po fr.po, 
  	then edit fr.po to update your translation.

Extra tools
-----------

* gif2xface.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	This perl script converts a monochrome (1 bit) 48x48 pixels GIF file
  	into an X-Face graphic suitable for inclusion into custom headers of
  	Sylpheed. An X-Face allows to quickly identify (or be identified as)
  	the sender of a mail message in a xface-capable MUA (like sylpheed).

  HOW TO USE IT
	After obtaining the desired image for your X-Face you should:
    	  * scale it to 48x48 pixels (Image->Scale image on Gimp)
    	  * down color depth to b/w (Image->Mode->Indexed selecting "Use
      	    Black/White palette" and the desired dithering options (prior to
      	    indexing doing Image->Colors->Threshold allows you to select the
      	    b/w level if you don't want a dithered (dotty) image))
    	  * save file as non-interlaced GIF
  	Then do:

      		./gif2xface < filename.gif > filename.xface

  	In filename.xface will be the X-Face header ready to use.
  	You can add a custom header in Sylpheed through Configuration->
  	Preferences per account, "Send" tab, check "Add user-defined header"
  	then "Edit..." if you want to add it via Sylpheed interface, or do

      		echo "0:" `cat filename.xface` > ~/.sylpheed/customheaderrc

  	if you want to create the custom headers file yourself (Warning: this
  	method is valid only if you don't have any other custom header set or
  	they will be lost!).

* launch_phoenix

  WHAT IT DOES
  	Check for a running phoenix process and and open a new tab with a 
  	given URL, or execute phoenix with that URL
  
  HOW TO USE IT  
  	In Common Preferences move to the 'Other' tab and enter the
  	following in the 'Web browser' box
  
  	launch_phoenix '%s'
