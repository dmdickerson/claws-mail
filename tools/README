* filter_conv.pl

  WHAT IT DOES

  This perl script provides easy conversion of your filtering rules
  form sylpheed's old filter system to the new filtering system used
  in sylpheed-claws. It reads 'filterrc' and outputs 'filteringrc'.

  HOW TO USE IT

  Move 'filter_conv.pl' to the ~/.sylpheed directory.
  From the ~/.sylpheed directory, issue the command:

        perl filter_conv.pl

  That's it, the new filtering system is now implemented with your
  previous rules applied.
