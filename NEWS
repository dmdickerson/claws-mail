  GPG page of the common preferences. Fixes annoyances with distro-
  installed gpg-agent, when no pinentry program is installed, and the
  user is at a loss on why "decryption failed". It can be turned off
  to bypass gpg-agent. The option is disabled if gpg-agent is not
  running.

* TrayIcon plugin: Added 'Hide at startup' and 'Close to tray'
  options.
  When the 'Close to tray' option is used the Window Manager's hotkey
  and [X] button will hide the window instead of closing it - closing
