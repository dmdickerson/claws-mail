New Cache Branch
----------------

This is the new cache release of sylpheed-claws. New cache is a development
branch to create a new data cache structure for sylpheed, that will solve
many of the problems sylpheed currently has with updates to flags. This
package is released to get more feedback from the users. It's not yet
finished and does not clean up memory yet, so you'll notice a large memory
usage if you have large folders after a while. But you will also notice a
large speed gain when you open these folders.  As this branch is not well
tested it might cause cache or flag file corruption that will cause a lose
of all flags for mails.

Folder updates are not done automatically yet for NEWS and IMAP, so you
will have to use the View / Update menu to update the folder content. New
mails in MH folders are not detected automatically like in the claws main
branch and you have to update the folder manually too, or activate the auto
update setting in the options.

The release is mainly to search for bugs or unexpected behaviour. Please
report to the sylpheed claws user mailing list.
