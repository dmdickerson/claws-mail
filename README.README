New Cache Branch
----------------

This is the new cache release of sylpheed-claws. New cache is a development
branch to create a new data cache structure for sylpheed, that will solve
many of the problems sylpheed currently has with updates to flags. This
package is released to get more feedback from the users.  But you will also
notice a large speed gain when you open these folders.  As this branch is
not well tested it might cause cache or flag file corruption that will cause
a lose of all flags for mails.

New cache uses two new configuration parameters that can be adjusted in
~/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc (no gui for them available yet).

    cache_max_mem_usage		(default: 4096)
	the maximum kB of memory sylpheed should use.
	It will try to keep the memory usage below this
	value, but it will always use the assigned
	amount of memory for speed gain.

    cache_min_keep_time		(default: 15)
	the minimum time in minutes sylpheed will keep
	the folder cache in memory. If a cache is more
	recent than this time it will not be freed even
	if the memory usage is above the maximum. You
	should probably set this value higher than your
	mail check interval. Otherwise the cache will
	always be freed between checks even if the folder
	is accessed on every check, which will cause much
	disk IO.

The check if memory can be freed is currently done after the active
folder has been changed or whenever a new cache is read, i.e. triggered
by mail incorporation.

New mails in MH folders are not detected automatically like in the claws
main branch and you have to update the folder manually, or activate
the auto update setting in the options.

The release is mainly to search for bugs or unexpected behaviour. Please
report to the sylpheed claws user mailing list.
