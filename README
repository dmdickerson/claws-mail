What's Sylpheed
===============

Sylpheed is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on
X Window System, and aiming for

 * Quick response
 * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
 * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
 * Abundant features

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also
designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands are
accessible with the keyboard.

The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it together
with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can also utilize
fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or
imget).

Currently implemented features are:

	o user-friendly and intuitive interface
	o 3-paned view like many Windoze-based mail client
	o ability of keyboard-only operation
	o Mew/Wanderlust-like key bind (most of normally used keys have been
	  implemented)
	o multipart MIME
	o built-in image view
	o X-Face support
	o external editor support
	o unlimited multiple account handling
	o message queueing
	o filtering
	o draft message function
	o line-wrapping
	o XML-based address book
	o APOP support
	o unread message management
	o multiple MH folder support
	o integrated NetNews client
	o IPv6 support
	o GnuPG support (currently implementing)
	o multithread support (experimental)
	o mbox importing
	o drag & drop (partially implemented)
	o fast thread display
	o high-speed message processing
	o lightweight resource usage
	o easily customizable configuration
	o supports automake + autoconf, and internationalization of message
	  by gettext
	o IMAP4 support (currently implementing)

You'll figure out the usage if you have used a mailer on Windows, or
Mew or Wanderlust.

Installation
============

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Usage
=====

How to run
----------

Input `sylpheed' on a command line, or double-click the icon on a file
manager to execute.

Initial startup
---------------

When Sylpheed is executed for the first time, it automatically creates the
configuration files under ~/.sylpheed/, and asks you the location of
mailbox. The default is ~/Mail. If some files which are non-MH format
already exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.

Required settings
-----------------

Initially, you have to create at least one account to send or receive
messages (you can read messages that already exist without creating
accounts). The configuration dialog will be shown by clicking
"Configuration -> Create new account..." on the menu, or "Account" on
the toolbar. Then, fill the required settings.

Refer to the manual supplied with this program for the general usage.
