What's Sylpheed
===============

Sylpheed is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on
X Window System, and aiming for

  * Quick response
  * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
  * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
  * Abundant features

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also
designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands are
accessible with the keyboard. You'll figure out the usage if you have ever
used some e-mail clients for Windows, or Mew or Wanderlust.

The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it together
with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can also utilize
fetchmail or/and procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or
imget).

Currently implemented features are:

	o POP3 support
	o IMAP4rev1 support
	o integrated NetNews client
	o unlimited multiple account handling
	o thread display
	o filtering
	o MIME (attachments)
	o built-in image view
	o X-Face support
	o multiple MH folder support
	o mbox importing / exporting
	o remote operation by command line
	o per-folder configuration
	o external editor support
	o message queueing
	o automatic mail checking
	o draft message function
	o template function
	o line-wrapping
	o clickable URI
	o XML-based address book
	o LDAP, vCard, and JPilot support
	o newly arrived and unread message management
	o Mew/Wanderlust-like key bind
	o printing
	o APOP authentication support
	o SMTP AUTH support
	o SSL support (POP3, SMTP, IMAP4rev1)
	o IPv6 support
	o drag & drop (partially implemented)
	o GnuPG support (currently in progress)
	o automake + autoconf support
	o internationalization of messages by gettext
	o support of many code sets, including UTF-8 (Unicode) (when using
	  libjconv)

and more.

Installation
============

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Usage
=====

Preparation before running
--------------------------

If you want to use characters other than English (aka US-ASCII),
you must specify some environmental variables related to locale.
For example:

% export LANG=de_DE	(sh, bash etc.)

or

% setenv LANG de_DE	(csh, tcsh etc.)

(replace de_DE to appropriate locale name)

If you don't want translated messages, set LC_MESSAGES to "C"
(and unset LC_ALL if specified).

How to run
----------

Input `sylpheed' on a command line, or double-click the icon on a file
manager to execute.

Initial startup
---------------

When Sylpheed is executed for the first time, it automatically creates the
configuration files under ~/.sylpheed/, and asks you the location of
mailbox. The default is ~/Mail. If some files which are non-MH format
already exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.

Required settings
-----------------

Initially, you have to create at least one account to send or receive
messages (you can read messages that already exist without creating
accounts). The configuration dialog will be shown by clicking
"Configuration -> Create new account..." on the menu, or "Account" on
the toolbar. Then, fill the required settings.

Refer to the manual supplied with this program for the general usage.

Hidden settings
---------------

You can configure most of the features in Sylpheed through the preferences
dialog, but there are a few parameters which don't have user interface
(you don't have to modify them in normal use). You must edit
~/.sylpheed/sylpheedrc by an editor when Sylpheed is not running.

bold_font			bold font used in folder, summary and text view
small_font			small font used in summary view etc.
enable_hscrollbar		enable horizontal scroll bar in summary view
				0: off  1: on	[default: 1]
bold_unread			show unread messages using bold font in
				summary view
				0: off  1: on   [default: 1]
folderview_vscrollbar_policy	specify the policy of vertical scroll bar
				of folder view
				0: always  1: automatic  2: never [default: 0]
