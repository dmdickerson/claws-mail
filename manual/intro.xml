    <title>What is Claws Mail?</title>
    <para>
	Claws Mail is an email client aiming at being fast, easy-to-use and powerful. It is mostly desktop-independent, but tries to integrate with your desktop as best as possible. The Claws Mail developers try hard to keep it lightweight, so that it should be usable on low-end computers without much memory or CPU power.

  <section id="intro_whatnot">
    <title>What Claws Mail is not</title>
    <para>
	Claws Mail is not a full-featured Personal Information Manager like Evolution or Outlook, although external plugins provide these functionalities. Claws Mail will not let you write and send HTML emails or other kind of annoyances, hence it may not be the software you need in some business environments.

  <section id="intro_history">
    <title>History of Claws Mail</title>
    <para>
	Claws Mail has existed since April 2001. The primary goal of Claws Mail was to be a test-bed for potential features of Sylpheed (<ulink url="http://sylpheed.good-day.net/">http://sylpheed.good-day.net/</ulink>), so that new features could be tested thoroughly without compromising Sylpheed's stability. Claws Mail developers regularly synchronised their codebase with Sylpheed's codebase, and Sylpheed's author, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, took back the new features he liked once they were stabilised.
    </para><para>
	Originally both Sylpheed and Claws Mail were based on GTK1. The work on the GTK2 versions started in early 2003, and the first modern (GTK2-based) Claws Mail was released in March 2005. Since about this time, Sylpheed and Claws Mail' goals started to diverge more, and Claws Mail became an entity of its own.
