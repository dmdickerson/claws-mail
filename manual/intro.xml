    <title>What is Sylpheed-Claws</title>
    <para>
	Sylpheed-Claws is an email client aiming at being fast, easy-to-use and powerful. It is mostly desktop-independent, but tries to integrate with your desktop as best as possible. The Sylpheed-Claws developers try hard to keep it lightweight, so that it should be usable on low-end computers without much memory or CPU power.

  <section id="intro_whatnot">
    <title>What Sylpheed-Claws is not</title>
    <para>
	Sylpheed-Claws is not a full-featured Personal Information Manager like Evolution or Outlook, although external plugins provide these functionalities. Sylpheed-Claws will not let you write and send HTML emails or other kind of annoyances, hence it may not be the software you need in some business environments.

  <section id="intro_history">
    <title>History of Sylpheed-Claws</title>
    <para>
	Sylpheed-Claws has existed since April 2001. The primary goal of Sylpheed-Claws was to be a test-bed for potentially new features of Sylpheed (<ulink url="http://sylpheed.good-day.net">http://sylpheed.good-day.net</ulink>), so that new features can be tested thoroughly without compromising Sylpheed's stability. Sylpheed-Claws developers synced regularly their codebase with Sylpheed's, and Sylpheed's author, Hiroyuki Yamamoto, took back the new features he liked once they were stabilised.
    </para><para>
	Originally both Sylpheed and Sylpheed-Claws were based on GTK1. The work on the GTK2 versions started in early 2003, and the first modern (GTK2-based) Sylpheed-Claws was released in March 2005. Since about this time, Sylpheed and Sylpheed-Claws' goals started to diverge more, and Sylpheed-Claws is now an entity of its own.
