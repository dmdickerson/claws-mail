      Plugins are the mechanism of extending Sylpheed-Claws capabilities. Imagine you want to store your mails in a remote <acronym>SQL</acronym> database. In most mailers out there this is simply impossible without reworking the internals of it. With Sylpheed-Claws you can simply write a plugin to achieve the task.
    </para>
    <para>This is only an example of the possibilities. Already exist a good number of plugins developed for Sylpheed-Claws, and more are to come. The <link linkend="ch_plugins">Extending Sylpheed-Claws section</link> is devoted to all of them.
